Rama, one of the most widely worshipped Hindu deities, considered the epitome of moral virtue and royal conduct. Although there are three Ramas mentioned in Indian tradition—Parashurama, Balarama, and Ramachandra—the name is specifically associated with Ramachandra, the seventh incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu.
Sita is a goddess in Hindu mythology who is also the avatar of the great goddess Lakshmi, wife of Vishnu. In the Ramayana, Sita is married to Rama, avatar of Vishnu.
The invincible and selfpossessed Rama entered the great forest of Dandaka and saw there a multitude of hermitages of the ascetics.
They (the hermitages) were strewn all over with kusa grass and robes by bark with auspicious sacrificial materials around and hence dazzling like the orb of the sun in the sky difficult to gaze.
The courtyards (of the hermitages) were cleanswept, sprinkled with water and decorated. They provided shelter to all kinds of creatures and were filled all over with  flocks of birds and antelopes.
The hermitages looked glorified with dances by celestial damsels. They were  adorned with vast fire sanctuaries, ladles for sacrificial ceremonies, deerskins and kusa grass faggots for pots of water, roots and fruits. They looked delightful with huge sacred trees of the forest laden with sweet fruits.
The hermitages where various sacrificial offerings were made reverberated with Vedic chantings. Flowers were scattered all over. There was a lotuspond with lotuses. There were aged, selfrestrained sages glowing like the Sun or the fire, living on fruits and roots, clothed in bark and dark  deerskin.
The hermitages echoing with  the sounds of Vedic recitations and resembling the very abode of Brahma were adorned with great, holy sages living on regulated diet.
The illustrious, effulgent Rama saw groups of hermitages adorned with venerable brahmins, with knowledge of the Supreme Spirit. On seeing them he loosened the string of his great bow and went forward.
On seeing Rama with illustrious Sita, the great sages, richly endowed with divine knowledge, went forward to greet him.
The sages, steadfast in their vows, saw Rama who was shining like the rising Moon, Lakshmana and the famed Sita went forward and received them with words of benediction.
Those sages living  in the forest were wonderstruck to see the handsome, graceful, delicate and welldressed Rama.
All the foresters looked at the wonderful figures of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana with unblinking eyes.
Ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, the sages made Rama, their guest, sit in their leafy hut.
The great sages comparable to the firegod and followers of righteousness honoured Rama  according to tradition by offering water.
The sages who were knowers of dharma saluted the noble Rama, offered fruits, roots and flowers available  at the hermitage and with folded palms said thus:
O king of great reputation, you are the refuge of the people, a protector of dharma, a chastiser of wrongdoers, a worshipful and respectable preceptor.
O Rama, in this world a king is considered the fourth part of Indra as he protects the people. Therefore, he is respected and he enjoys the choicest pleasures of life.
Since we are the residents of your territory we deserve to be protected by you. Whether you live in the city or in the forest, you are the lord of the people and our king.
O king, we have conquered our anger and have controlled our senses. We ascetics have cast aside all our authority. We are like your children and need to be protected by you forever
Having said so, the ascetics offered with reverence fruits, roots, flowers and other forest  products to Rama and Lakshmana.
After receiving hospitality from the sages, Rama took of all of them at sunrise and entered deep into the forest.
With Lakshmana following, Rama went through the forest, filled with herds of animals and inhabited by bears and tigers. It was a place where trees, creepers and bushes were crushed (by frequent visits of demons). It was difficult to locate a water source.  And it resounded with the chirping of various birds and insects (crickets).
While Rama along with Sita was wandering in the forest infested with  dreadful animals, he saw a roaring cannibal resembling the peak of a mountain.
He was of dreadful appearance with deep eyes, a huge face and a big belly. He looked tall, ugly and frightening.
Wearing a tigerskin, he resembled the god of death. With a wide, open mouth, wet with marrow and drenched with blood, he struck terror into  all beings.
Roaring loudly, he carried an iron spit in which were pierced three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten deer  and the huge head of an elephant with its tusks smeared with the fat of flesh.
Looking extremely furious, he ran towards Rama, Lakshmana and Sita like the god of death rushes towards the (dying) people.
Making a dreadful sound, as if shaking the earth, he took Sita on his lap, stepped aside and said:
You both clad in bark and wearing matted hair, holding bows, arrows and swords have entered into the Dandaka forest with your wife. Your life has been cut short indeed৷৷
How is it that you both, dressed in the robes of ascetics, live  with a woman? Leading an unrighteous and sinful life, who are you who have brought disgrace to the ascetic discipline ?
I am a demon named Viradha. I move in this dense forest with my weapons eating the flesh of the sages.
This  woman of fine hips shall be my wife. You sinners I shall drink  the blood of both of you in the fight.
Sita, daughter of Janaka was bewildered out of fear when she heard the cruel  and boastful words of that wicked Viradha.
Seeing the auspicious Sita in the lap of Viradha shaken out of anxiety, like a plantain tree in a strong wind, Rama with his throat parched said to Lakshmana:
Gentle Lakshmana, see the illustrious daughter ofJanaka, a lady of good conduct,  brought up in utmost comfort caught in the lap of Viradha
O Lakshmana whatever Kaikeyi desired through her boons has now come true so soon.
Kaikeyi, my middle mother is farsighted indeed  Not content with the kingdom alone see sent me, beloved of all  beings, away to the forest. Let her cherished desire be fulfilled.
O Lakshmana nothing is more sorrowful to me than the touch of Vaidehi by another. It is more painful to me than the death of my father or loss of my kingdom.
As Rama was thus full of tears of sorrow, Lakshmana sighed heavily in anger like a hissing serpant in confinement. And said:
O Rama, you are, like Indra, lord of all beings. What makes you feel sad like an orphan when I am at your service like a servant?
The earth will drink the blood of Viradha with his life gone, slain by my angry arrow.
Like Indra who hits the mountain with his thunderbolt, I shall release on Viradha the anger I felt against Bharata for his passion for the kingdom.
Spurred by the speed of my strong arms, my arrow will fall on his broad chest and separate his life from his body. Then his body reeling round and round will fall on the ground.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वितीयस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the second sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Graceful Lakshmana asked  Viradha  with a smile, Who are you wandering in the forest at will ?.
Then Viradha with his voice filling the forest said, Instead of asking about me you both should speak out who  you are and where you are going
Questioned by the demon, who bore a burning countenance, the highly effulgent Rama introduced his Ikshvaku family:
Know us to be both kshatriyas, endowed with a good lineage and yet moving in the forest. We both wish to know, who you are and why you are going about in Dandaka forest?
Then Viradha said to Rama whose truth was his strength, I will tell you who I am. O, listen:
I am indeed son to Jaya. My mother is Satahrada. Verily all the demons on this earth call me Viradha.
By the grace of Lord Brahma I was bestowed with this prowess through my penance. In this world none can kill me with a weapon nor split nor cut me to pieces.
Therefore, leave this lady and run away to the place you came from. I will not take away your life .
With eyes reddened with anger Rama replied to the sinful, deformed Viradha:
O vile, mean creature  surely you are seeking death. Wait, you will meet it in the fight.
Then Rama strung his bow immediately, shot the sharp arrows at Viradha and hit him verily.
From his bow  strung tight,  Rama shot seven swift, goldenfeathered arrows comparable to Garuda  and the Windgod in speed.
The arrows tied with peacockfeathers, looking like fire, pierced the body of Viradha which, drenched in blood, fell on the ground.
Hit  by Rama and Lakshmana, the enraged  demon left Vaidehi, lifted a sharp spear   and ran towards them.
The demon who produced a great noise with his wide open mouth resembled the god of death. He lifted a sharp spike that looked like Indra's banner.
And then both the brothers showered bright arrows on the demon Viradha who looked like Yama, the god of death.
The demon who was extremely frightening stood there, laughing and yawning.  As he yawned, all the swiftlyflying arrows fell out of his body.
By virtue of a boon Viradha, the demon, controlled the vital breath of his body by a mere touch and, raising the spike, ran towards the two Raghava princes.
With two arrows, Rama, the best among wielders of weapons, broke down the spike in the sky burning like fire, and resembling the  thunderbolt of Indra.
The spike, broken down by Rama's arrow, fell like a slab of mount Meru splintered by Indra's thunder.
Then both Rama and Lakshmana quickly raised their swords which looked like black serpents and at once fell upon the demon who was going to strike with great force.
Struck down, the angry demon tightly caught hold of both of them under his arms and wanted to set out, carrying Rama and Lakshmana, the two unshakeable tigers among men.
Rama understood the intention of the demon and said to Lakshmana, Let him go his way, no need to stop him.
O Lakshmana, let the nightstalker go the way he wishes. That is, in fact, our path.
Puffed up with his own great strength, Viradha lifted them and placed them on his shoulders as though they were two children.
Then the nightstalker proceeded towards the forest, carrying both the scions of the Raghu race on his shouldersroaring.
Seeing those two mightyarmed Rama and Lakshmana being carried away by Viradha, Sita started crying loudly:
The wild bears, tigers and panthers will eat me up here. O best among demons, pray take me and leave both the Kakutsthas.
On hearing those words of  Sita, both the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana hastened to kill the wicked Viradha.
Lakshmana quickly broke the left and Rama the right shoulder of that dreadful demon.
With both shoulders broken, the demon, looking like a cloud (huge and dark) fell at once on the ground like a mountain split by a thunderbolt.
Striking the demon with fists, knees and feet, both of them smit him  on the bare ground and pulverized him.
Although pierced by arrows, and wounded by the two swords, and pulverized on the ground, the demon did not die.
Seeing the mountainlike Viradha not dying though seriously wounded, illustrious Rama, guaranter of safety from fear said to Lakshmana:
O Lakshmana, best among men, this demon by virtue of his penance cannot be killed with any weapon in war. Therefore, let us bury him.
Dig a deep pit to bury this demon, dreadful like an elephant and emitting a fearful glow.
Courageous Rama standing there put his foot firmly on the neck of Viradha and said to Lakshmana,' Dig up a crevice'.
When the demon Viradha heard Rama saying so, he said these humble words to the scion of the Kakutsthas and the best of men :
You have killed me, O Rama, a tiger among men. You are equal to Indra in prowess. O best of men, out of delusion I could not recognise you earlier.
O dear Rama, I know now you are the blessed son of Kausalya, Sita is a noble lady and a glorious soul.
I am Tumburu by name,  a celestial singer of the gandharva clan. Cursed by Kubera, I got this dreadful body of a demon.
When I appealed to him, that lord of great fame (Kubera) said that I would get back my original form and ascend to heaven when Rama, son of Dasaratha, would kill me in a duel.
When king Kubera saw me absent (from duty) as I was infatuated with Rambha, he got angry and cursed me.
O scorcher of enemies by your grace I am rid of the curse. Delivered from my dreadful form, I will now go to my world. May both of you fare well.
O dear, there lives Sarabhanga, a righteous sage, comparable to the Sun, at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here. Go to him at once. He will bless you with your wellbeing.
Bury me in the pit, O Rama, and proceed happily. This is a great tradition for the dead demons. Those who are buried in the pit attain heaven.
Having said so to Rama, the mighty  Viradha, hit by the arrows left his body and attained heaven.
When Rama heard those words, he said, O Lakshmana dig for this elephantlike demon of dreadful acts, a big pit. Having said so the mighty Rama stood firmly stamping the neck of Viradha with his foot.
Then Lakshmana fetched a spade and dug a sufficiently big pit by the side of the great soul Viradha.
Rama took his foot off Viradha's neck and dropped his body with pointed ears into the pit while Viradha was groaning fearfully৷৷
Rama and Lakshmana, stable and firm, brave and quick, together lifted the body of Viradha who was fierce in battle and roaring and forcibly threw it into the pit with joy.
The two princes, bulls among men, who were adept in archery saw that the great demon could not be killed by any other means. They reflected over the issue  and undertook the task of killing him with sharp weapons and buried him in a pit.
Rama deliberately wanted to kill Viradha with weapons. Viradha the forestranger himself revealed that it was not possible to kill him with weapons and asked Rama to bury him in a pit.
While Rama, who had made up his mind after hearing him, was putting the mighty demon in the pit, the forest rang with his roar.
Rama and Lakshmana were happy to consign Viradha's body to the pit after killing him. They filled the pit with rocks in the great forest without fear.
On killing Viradha, the demon of terrific strength, heroic Rama embraced Sita, consoled her and said to his brother Lakshmana, glowing like fire:
This wild forest with which we have not been acquainted earlier is difficult  to pass. (Hence) let us proceed quickly to sage Sarabhanga.
Rama went to the hermitage of Sarabhanga, a sage with divine grace who had realised the supreme (by his penance). Thus by the side of the sage he witnessed a huge wonder.
Rama saw the lord of the gods (Indra) in the sky getting off the chariot, with his body shining brightly like the sun or the fire, followed by the gods, his feet untouched by the earth. Clad in spotless attire and adorned with shining ornaments, he was being worshipped by many greatsouls like him.
Not far from that place, Rama saw a chariot, yoked with tawnycoloured horses, shining like the morning  Sun. It looked like a palewhite cloud, resembling the lunar orb.
Rama saw a pure white umbrella with a highly expensive golden staff, decorated with variegated flower garlands.While near his (Indra's) head stood a pair of exquisite ladies with fans made of yak's tail.
Many celestial singers of heaven, gods, great sages and siddhas sang with the choicest words the glory of this god stationed in the sky.
While Indra was conversing with Sarabhanga, Rama saw him and said to Lakshmana.
Pointing at the chariot, Rama said, Lakshmana, see this wonderful, effulgent chariot endowed with grace is shining like the Sun in the sky.
The horses of Indra, who is often invoked (during sacrificial rituals) and about whom  we have heard earlier, are now stationed in the sky.
O Lakshmana  around the chariot stand hundreds of finest young men of about twentyfive years. Clad in red robes, they are wearing earrings, and holding swords in their hands. They have broad chests and stout arms like iron beams. Like tigers, they are difficult to overpower. They have necklaces hanging on their chests blazing like fire.
These tigers among men have cheerful countenacess from which it can be deduced that the age of the gods always remains constant.
Lakshmana, stay here with Sita awhile, until I ascertain who this dazzling being on the chariot is.
Instructing Lakshmana to wait , Rama  went towards Sarabhanga's hermitage.
Then Indra (husband of Sachi) having seen Rama coming towards him, approached Sarabhanga and said this to him privately:
Here comes Rama. Before he talks to me, take me to some other place from where he may not be able to see me. He has to do a great task which is difficult for others. I can see him when he accomplishes the taste and emerges victorious.
This way honouring the sage Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, took leave of him and went to heaven in his chariot harressed with horses.
When Indra departed like that, Rama with his retinue (Sita and Lakshmana) went to Sarabhanga who was sitting by the side of the firealtar (for Agnihotra).
Rama, Sita and Lakshmana prostrated at Sarabhanga's feet. After being permitted to sit, they were invited to stay there.
Thereafter on Rama's query Sarabhanga told him all about Indra's visit:
O Rama, Indra, the bestower of boons, wants to take me to the world of Brahma,  earned by me through severe penance which is most difficult to be attained by those devoid of selfrealisation.
O Rama, the best among men you are a very dear guest to me and knowing that you are near, I will not go to the world of Brahman without seeing you.
O Rama, the best of men  (only) after seeing a great, virtuous soul like you shall I go to heaven, the abode of the gods.
O tiger among men, I have conquered heavenly abodes as well as the imperishable, auspicious worlds of Brahma. Accept them all that are mine (obtained through my penance)
To these words of sage Sarabhanga Rama, the best of men, the knower of all sastras, the scion of the Raghus replied:
O great sage, I will earn all the worlds myself if you direct me. But I need a proper dwellingplace in this forest.
To this request of Rama who was equal to Indra in strength, sagacious Sarabhanga said these words:
Here dwells in this forest a brilliant saint, righteous and selfcontrolled, Sutikshna by name who will look to your welfare, O Rama
You may approach sage, Sutikshna residing in a sacred spot. He will provide you a delightful place for your stay in the forest.
Proceed, O Rama  in the reverse direction of the river Mandakini carrying flowers and floats. And you will reach the place.
O Rama, the best among men, this is the way. Look at me for a while, my dear, until I shed my limbs just as a snake sheds its withered slough.
Then the effulgent Sarabhanga, knower of mantras (magical spells) kindled the fire with faggots and after offering oblations of ghee plunged in.
Then were consumed that highsouled Sarabhanga's hair on the body and on the head, the wornout skin, the bones and flesh along with blood.
Sarabhanga then emerged youthful from that heap of fire, shining like a flame and looking very elegant৷৷
Sarabhanga then went beyond the worlds of the gods, of the great sages who constantly kindle sacrificial fire, and ascended to the world of Brahman.
Sarabhanga, performer of sacred deeds, saw Brahma with his followers৷৷ Brahma also seeing Sarabhanga, the best among the brahmins,  welcomed him gladly.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चमः सर्गः।।Thus ends the fifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Sarabhanga attained the heaven, all the sages collected together and came to Rama whose radiance was like fire.
Vaikhanasas, Valakhilyas, sages who continuously wash their bodies, Marichakas Asmakuttas sages who live on leaves only, those who have teeth like mortar, Unmajjakas, those who use limbs as their bed, those who practise penance without using a bed, those who do penance in the open, unmindful of rain or Sun or wind, those who live on water only, those who penance under the open sky, those who carry on penance on high places like the mountaintop, those who recline on bare ground only, those who observe fast as a part of religious tradition, those selfrestrained men, those who mutter sacred mantras, those who constantly perform penance and those who stand under the blazing Sun in summer placing fire on four sides while performing penanceall these types of sages met Rama in the hermitage of Sarabhanga.
All groups of sages, who knew dharma, and were upholders of righteousness reached Rama, the supreme knower of dharma, and said:
O great charioteer you are the lord of the Ikshvaku race and of the world just like Indra, chief among the gods.
You are renowned in the three worlds for your valour, for your devotion to father, and in you lies enough evidence of your adherence to truth and righteousness.
O lord, do excuse us. We sought your help to fulfil our needs since you are at hand. You are a great soul, knower and lover of dharma.
O Lord, a king who collect one sixth of the produce as tax and yet does not protect his subjects like his children commits an act of grave injustice.
O Rama, whoever protects the inhabitants of his kingdom at all times like his own son who he loves more than his own life will attain the world of Brahma and remain there for long years and will achieve prosperity thereafter.
One fourth of the supreme merit a sage earns by living on fruits and roots, accrues to the king through which the people are protected righteously.
O Rama  we are a group of great sages, mostly brahmins, leading a vanaprastha  life. Yet with a protector like you, we are slaughtered in large numbers like orphans.
Come and see  the bodies of ascetics, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit, killed in large numbers in the forest by the fierce demons.
A great slaughter is taking place amongst those residing on the bank of the Pampa lake, near the river Mandakini, and on mount Chitrakuta.
We ascetics are not able to tolerate the fearful deeds perpetrated by the dreadful demons in the forest.
O Rama, you are worthy of refuge. Hence we have come to you seeking your protection. We are being killed by the nightstalkers. Save us.
O great warrior here on this earth there is no protector as mighty as you. So, O prince  save us all from these demons.
Having heard this, righteous Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty said to all the ascetics engaged in penance:
You should not speak to me this way. I deserve to be commanded by the ascetics. I have not entered this forest only on a personal mission.
I came into this forest in obedience to my father's orders to repel the aggression of demons against you.
I came here to acomplish your task incidentally, Therefore, my stay in the forest will yield great results.
I wish to kill in the fight the demons who are your enemies. O great ascetics, you may  witness my prowess supported by my brother.
Brave Rama, steadfast in righteousness, worthy of honour, gave assurance to protect the ascetics endowed with the wealth of penance, and proceeded towards sage Sutikshna.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षष्ठस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, the scorcher of enemies, along with his brother Lakshmana and Sita and the sages went to Sutikshna's hermitage.
After covering a long distance and crossing the river (Ganga) with plenty of water, Rama saw a huge mountain looking like a lofty cloud.
Rama and Lakshmana, the best of the Ikshvaku family, accompanied by Sita entered the dense forest  filled with trees all over.
Entering that dreadful forest, they saw trees full of flowers and fruits, and a hermitage in a lonely place with lines of bark robes hanging.
There at the hermitage was Sutikshna, an ascetic grown old with (long) penance, wearing soiled, matted locks and seated. Rama (first) addressed him as per custom.
O venerable one, I am Rama.You are a great sage, armed with truth as your prowess and a knower of dharma. I have come to see you. Could you speak to me?
Thereafter the composed Sutikshna, looked at Rama, the best among righteous men, and embracing him with both his arms said:
O Rama, the best among the Raghavas and among the upholders of truth, you are welcome. With your presence this hermitage will have a protector now.
O renowned hero, I had heard that you have come to Chitrakuta, renouncing your  kingdom. I have been waiting so long to see you here. Unable to give up this body, I did not even leave the earth for heaven, the world of the gods.
O scion of the Kakutstha family, Indra, king of the gods came to me and said that by my meritorious deeds I have won all the worlds.
Along with your wife and Lakshmana you may roam by my grace the worlds won by me and served by divine sages like devarsi Narada.
Selfpossessed Rama replied to the truthful ascetic who had performed intense penance. Just as Kasyapa would address Lord Brahma:
O great sage I will win all the worlds myself. I (only) want to live in this forest. Allow me.
You are ever engaged in the welfare of all beings. I have heard this from the great sage Sarabhanga of Gautama's clan.
Thus addressed by  Rama, Sutikshna, the great sage, wellknown to the world was highly delighted. He (then) said these sweet words:
O Rama this is a salubrious hermitage where hosts of sages live and which is full of roots and fruits, you may enjoy yourself here.
O illustrious Rama, herds of animals visit this place fearlessly, enticing the inmates and (then) go back without harming any one.
When heroic Rama heard that there was no other problem from the wild animals except their frequent incursions, he lifted his bow with an arrow and said these words:
O reverend one, I will kill with a sharpedged arrow, glowing like a thunderbolt, all those herds of animals who keep coming here.
What can be more agonizing for you (than my killing animals). I (therefore) do not foresee our long stay in this hermitage.
Rama stopped with this. And then the evening drew to a close. Offering his evening oblation, he arranged for his stay along with Sita and Lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of Sutikshna.
Seeing that the evening had passed and night had set in, the great sage Sutikshna with due hospitality, served those best of men, food fit for ascetics.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, worshipped by Sutikshna and accompanied by Lakshmana, spent the night at the hermitage, and got up early in the morning.
In the morning Rama and Sita got up in time and took bath in cool, lilyfragrant water.
And as per routine, sinless Sita, Rama and Lakshmana offered prayers to the fire and other gods of the forest which was the refuge of the ascetics. Seeing the rising Sun, they worshipped him, and approaching Sutikshna,  said these soothing words:
O revered Sutikshna received by one so worshipworthy like you, we spent the night well. We (now)take leave of you. The sages  are hastening us.
We wish to see the entire circle of hermitages of the sages, residing in Dandaka forest. So we are in a hurry.
We seek your permission to go with the great sages, who are ever engaged in righteousness, selfcontrolled by virtue of their penance, and are like flameless fire.
We wish to depart before the Sun grows unbearably hot like the man devoid of good lineage who acquires wealth through unlawful means (becomes arrogant). Thereafter Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana offered worship at the feet of the venerable sage.
When both Rama and Lakshmana touched the feet of Sutikshna, the best of the sages, he lifted them up, hugged them tightly, and said affectionately:
You may safely tread, O Rama, this path along with Lakshmana and Sita who is following you like a shadow.
O valient Rama the sages, living in  the Dandaka forest, are self realised souls. See how delightful is the location of their hermitages.
You will see the beautiful forestareas with abundant fruits and roots, flowers in full bloom, herds of animals, flocks of quiet birds tanks and lakes filled  with clean waters and shining with fully blossomed lotuses, resounding with waterducks and peacocks  and waterfalls coming down the hills. Thus you will enjoy a delightful sylvan sight.
O dear Rama, O Lakshmana you may leave (now), you may have to come back to this hermitage after seeing those places.
Thus addressed, Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas along with Lakshmana circumambulated the sage (in reverence) and set forth.
Thereafter largeeyed Sita handed the brothers two quivers, two bows as well as two excellent swords.
Both Rama and Lakshmana  tied their auspicious quivers, took the two twanging bows and departed from the hermitage.
Handsome Rama and Lakshmana, glowing in their radiance held the bows and exited  with Sita.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the eighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While Rama was leaving with the permission of Sutikshna, Sita spoke these warm, affectionate words to her husband:
This great path of dharma you are following now can be attained only through subtle means by one free from addiction born of passion.
There are three kinds of vices born out of lust. First, speaking untruth, second, having sexual relation with others' wives and third, resorting to violence with no enmity. The later two vices are of serious nature.
O Rama you never spoke untruth in the past nor will you speak in future. How can there be any desire in you to destroy the virtue of others' wives ?
O Rama, lord among men, you hadn't it (lust for other women) in the past. You havn't it now. Never does it exist even in your mind.
O prince, you are always faithful to your wife. You are righteous, truthful and obedient to your father's orders.
O Rama, you are truthful, honourable, powerful. O elder brother of Lakshmana, in you is established truth and righteousness.
O longarmed one, to contain all this is only possible for those who have conquered the senses. O handsome one, I know your ability to control the senses.
(But) you are a victim to the third (vice born of lust) i.e. showing violence without cause for enmity
O valiant one, you have promised to kill the demons in the battle, in order to protect the sages residing in the Dandaka forest.
It is only on account of this that you entered the wellknown Dandaka forest with your brother wielding bow and arrows.
I am, therefore, worried in my mind when I see you here and think of your wellbeing. I wish your ultimate good. [The next two lines appear, more or less, a repetition. So omitted : Editor]
O brave Rama, I do not like your going to Dandaka forest. I shall tell you the reason. Do listen.
Of course, you will go to the forest with your brother, holding the bow and arrows. Release the arrows when you see the forestrangers.
A bow in the hand of a kshatriya is like fuel to fire. It surely swells his strength and his brilliance.
O mightyarmed one, there dwelt in the past an ascetic, noble and truthful in a sacred forest where animals and birds lived merrily together.
Once Indra, husband of Sachi, came to his hermitage in the guise of an attendant, sword in hand, in order to hinder his penance.
Then while the sage was practising penance at the hermitage, he gave him that excellent sword to be kept in trust.
Having received the weapon as a trust, the sage went wandering in the forest, always attentive in safeguarding the weapon.
Vigilant about protecting the sword deposited with him, the sage never moved without it even when he went gathering roots and fruits.
While the sage moved about holding the weapon, he gave up the practice of penance gradually and developed a violent mindset.
By association with the sword, he developed a violent attitude. And in that habitual state of excitement he was dragged into unrighteous ways which (ultimately) took him to hell.
Contact with the weapon has led to this in the past. Like contact with fire, it leads man to destruction. I say this out of my love and reverence for you as a reminder and not as an instruction.
While holding a bow, you should not have the intention to kill demons residing in Dandaka with no animosity against you. O valiant one  I do not desire that any one should be killed without incurring any offence.
It is the duty of a kshatriya, a warrior to protect with his bow those who practise selfcontrol (penance) in the forest in a state of panic.
Where is the question of wielding a weapon and living in the forest, where is the life of a kshatriya and the life of penance? For us, this is an encroachment. Let the law of the land be honoured.
Lord, when we handle the weapon, the mind gets vitiated. (Only) after returning to Ayodhya can you perform the duty of a kshatriya.
You would have been on unlimited source of joy to my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw had you permanently renounced the kingdom for the life of an ascetic.
Righteousness brings wealth. Wealth brings happiness. Righteousness brings everything. In fact, the essence of the world is righteousness.
The wise earn dharma through getting their bodies emaciated by carefully adopting different means of discipline (selftorture). Happiness does not beget happiness.
O gentle one you may move in this forest of ascetics with a pure mind. The true meaning behind everything in these three worlds is known to you, indeed.
Having heard these words spoken by Sita who was devoted to her husband, replied Rama who was firm in righteousness.
O daughter of Janaka, you are conversant with dharma. Whatever you have admonished out of affection for me is befitting your race.
But permit me, Devi, you have already stated, when a kshatriya holds a bow there will be no cry of distress. (it means you approve of my holding a bow)
O Sita, the sages who perform rigorous penance in Dandaka forest came to me personally, seeking shelter although they can be their own protection.
The sages living in the forest, eating roots and fruits and ever engaged in righteous activities are afraid of the depredations of the demons, with their happiness gone.
The sages engrossed in various austerities in the forest have been victims to the dreadful demons living on human flesh.
The ascetics, the best of brahmins living in Dandaka forest being eaten up like that besought me to come to their rescue.
On hearing the words that came from their mouth, I bowed at their feet and said:
Be pleased  That brahmins like you have approached me while I should have come to you has put me to shame immeasurable .
I enquired about what I could do for them. And all the brahmins in one voice said:.
'O Rama, the demons who can assume any form at their will are mercilessly tormenting us in Dandaka forest. Do protect us from them'.
'O sinless one, these cannibals are invincible. They arrive at the time of our sacrificial rituals, on the days of festivities or at the time of lunar conjunctions like no moon or full moon days and attack us.
'You are the supreme refuge for us ascetics, tormented by demons, helpless men in search of shelter.
'O Rama it is difficult to perform penance which is ever full of obstacles. Therefore, we do not pronounce curses even if eaten up by demons'.
'The demons, dwelling in the Dandaka forest are tormenting us. You alone are our lord in the forest. Do protect us with your brother.'
O daughter of Janaka, on hearing the words of the sages I promised to undertake the entire protection of sages of the Dandaka forest.
Having promised the sages, I cannot do otherwise as long as I have life in me. To me truth is always dear.
O Sita I may forfeit my life forsake, even Lakshmana and you but will not break the promise made specially to the brahmins৷৷
Even before the sages requested me I should have protected them. What to speak of the promise I have already made ?
O sinless one all that has been said by you is out of your love and affection for me. I am pleased. What is harmful is never advised.
Your auspicious words are quite befitting your lineage. You are the follower of my dharma and so dearer to me than my life.
Having said this to Sita, the princess of Mithila, Rama along with Lakshmana, bow in hand, moved about the delightful penancegrove.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे दशमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the tenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by the sage Valmiki.
Rama walked in front, Sita with a beautiful waist, in the middle and Lakshmana holding the bow, behind them৷৷
Both Rama and Lakshmana walked on, accompanied by Sita, watching several beautiful mountain ranges, forests  and rivers.
(Watching) the swans and ruddy geese on river banks and lakes full of lotuses, and birds on water and in the sky.
(Watching) herds of deer, intoxicated horned buffaloes, wild boars and elephants who are enemies of trees (elephants uproof trees).
As the Sun was setting, they had covered a long distance, watching a yojanalong tank adorned with lotuses, and crowded with herds of elephants and flocks of cranes, swans and aquatic animals.
In that lake of clear waters they heard the sounds of songs and musical instruments, while there were none around.
Out of curiosity, mighty Rama, and Lakshmana started enquiring about the matter from sage Dharmabrata by name:
O great sage, this very wonderful sound, has whetted our great curiosity. If there is no top secret about this, do disclose it.
Thus addressed by Rama, the righteous sage narrated the entire origin of the lake.
O Rama this lake called Panchapsara  filled with water at all times has been created through penance by a sage called Mandakarni.
Great sage Mandakarni standing in water and living on air performed  rigorous penance for ten thousand years.
Thereafter very much perturbed, all the gods led by Agni gathered together at one place and started deliberating among themselves.
'The gods of heaven became agitated in their minds thinking the sage might usurp one of their places.
All the gods then engaged five of the important nymphs, glittering like lightning, to disturb the penance of the sage.
The sage, a knower of the inner self and the world of plurality, was gripped by passion for the apsaras, who had come to achieve the target of the gods.
The five apsaras, got the status of wives to the sage who built them an invisible home inside the lake.
The apsaras lived happily with the sage who remained youthful by virtue of his penance.
While the apsaras played their musical instruments, their melodious songs mingled with the sounds of ornaments are heard.
Glorious Rama and his brother heard the wonderful words of the selfrealised sage and exclaimed, 'How strange '
When the sage Dharmabrata was telling the story, Rama saw a hermitage strewn all over with kusa grass and bark garments, and endowed with pure brahminic grace.
Illustrious Rama accompanied by Vaidehi and Lakshmana entered the hermitage and, honoured by all the sages, stayed there.
Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha race, wielder of great weapons, stayed in that beautiful hermitage, accepting the hospitality of the sages extended with due honour, He visited in turn their penancegroves where he repeated his stay.
Rama lived happily here for about ten months, there one year, here four or five or six months and there over one or half a month or three or eight months in another.
Thus enjoying their stay in the hermitages, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana spent ten favourable years.
Rama went round who was full of grace and full of knowledge on dharma went round with Sita and came back to Suthikshna's hermitage.
On his arrival, Rama, the subduer of enemies, was honoured by the sages at the hermitage where he stayed for a short time.
Once while sitting beside sage Sutikshna at the hermitage Rama humbly addressed him:
I have heard others saying that lord Agastya, the great sage, lives in this forest.
I am unable to locate the sacred hermitage of that sagacious sage due to the vastness of this forest.
By your grace, I wish to go there with Sita and my brother Lakshmana to offer our respectful salutations.
There is a great desire  in my heart to serve in person the best of sages, Agastya.
Hearing the words of Rama, the righteous son of Dasaratha, sage Sutikshna was pleased to reply:
I also wished you, O Raghava, to visit Agastya along with Sita and Lakshmana.
Luckily you have asked me on your own. I will tell you where the great sage Agastya lives.
Dear Rama, walk from here a distance of four yojanas. There in the southerly direction  stands the great, beautiful hermitage of Agastya's brother.
This plain land in the beautiful forest tract is adorned with fig trees,filled with  flowers, fruits, and delightful sounds of different birds.
O Rama, there are lotusponds filled with clear, sacred waters, with different kinds of swans, ducks and ruddy geese. Spend one night there and proceed early in the morning.
If you go in the southern direction for a yojana you will find Agasthya's hermitage by the side of a cluster of trees.
Vaidehi will feel happy in your company in that delightful forest region full of many trees.So too will Lakshmana.
O glorious one, if you have made up your mind to visit that great sage Agastya, think of starting today itself.
Rama heard the words of the sage, offered him reverential salutations and set out along with his brother and Sita.
Enjoying the sight of delightful forests, cloudlike mountains, lakes and rivers on the  way, and following the directions given by  Sutikshna, Rama was happy. He said  to Lakshmana:
Surely this is the hermitage of great Agastya's brother, a man of holy deeds.
This is the glade we were told about with thousands of trees drooping down with abundant fruits and flowers.
Feel this sudden astringent smell of ripe figs wafted by the breeze from the forest.
Heaps of firewood are seen here and there on the path. There are blades of grass (used for sacrificial ceremonies) shining like vaidurya (gems).
In the middle of the forest can be seen like the tip of the dark clouds columns of smoke coming out of the top of hermitages.
Priests are coming out of the solitary sacred spots after their bath and making offerings of flowers they had themselves plucked.
O handsome one, surely this is the hermitage of Agastya's brother about which I heard from Sutikshna.
Assuming the form of a brahmin and using Sanskrit language, Ilvala would invite brahmins for offering shraddha to the dead
Ilvala would keep his brother sanctified, so that he is fit for offering, Then he would feed the brahmins with mutton according to the rituals.
Then when the brahmins finished eating, Ilvala would call aloud, 'O Vatapi come out'.
Then hearing his brother's voice, Vatapi would bleat like a sheep and jump out, tearing open the bodies of those brahmins.
In this manner, thousands of brahmins used to be killed daily by those carnivorous demons who assumed any form at their free will.
Urged by the gods, Agastya  came  for the shradda . The mighty demon played the same routine trick and Vatapi, for sure, was eaten by the great sage.
Saying, the ritual is complete Ilvala offered water in the palm of Agastya and called his brother to come out.
Wise Agastya,  the best among the ascetics, laughing aloud, said to Ilvala, the destroyer of brahmins:
I have digested the demon Vatapi your brother, who assumed the form of a sheep. He has reached the abode of Yama, Lord of death. Where does he have the power to come out?
On hearing the news of the death of his brother, the demon Ilvala, out of anger, started attacking the sage.
Ilvala who pounced upon Agastya, the best among the sages whose lustre lay consumed by the fire of his eyes which were in flames.
This hermitage surrounded by beautiful lakes and forests belongs to his brother (Sudarsana). Out of sympathy for Agastya, he has accomplished this difficult task.
While Rama was thus narrating to Lakshmana (the story of Agastya), the Sun set and evening closed in.
Rama with his brother Lakshmana duly offered oblations at twilight, entered the hermitage and greeted the sage (Sudarsana) with folded palms.
Warmly received by the sage, Rama shared the roots and fruits and slept the night there.
When the night passed and the Sun became bright, Rama took leave of the brother of Agastya.
O Lord, the night has been wellspent. Now we humbly seek leave of you to see your respectable elder brother.
With his permission, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, proceeded along the path indicated, watching (the beauty of) the forest.
They passed by wild rice fields, jackfruit trees, palmyra and various other trees like Ashoka, trees with white flowers, old trees that existed for a long time, mahva trees, bilva trees and tindukas.
Rama saw hundreds of trees crushed by the trunks of elephants and by monkeys. He saw some trees echoing with notes of hundreds of intoxicated birds. He saw tree tops coiled with creepers in full bloom.
Then the lotuseyed Rama said to the chivalrous, graceful Lakshmana who stood behind him:
The leaves of the trees here are glossy, the animals and birds are peaceful. It appears the hermitage of the selfrealized great sage Agastya is not very far from here.
Here is the hermitage of Agastya, wellknown in the world for his deeds a place of rest for those tired with hard work.
This forest is enveloped with the smoke rising from the sacrificial altar. There are rows of bark robes hanging. Herds of quiet animals lying and different kind of birds chirping around.
This is his hermitage. On account of his (Agastya's) impact the demons look south but cannot eat the hermits out of fear (for the sage).
Since the time Agastya of sacred deeds occupied this direction the demons are quiet, leaving all enmity.
The southern side favourable to the people was famous by the name Agastya in the three worlds and stood unassailable to the demons.
This is the hermitage of the longlived Agastya who is renowned for his deeds and is served by humble people. The great mountain Vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the Sun stopped growing any more in obedience to Agastya's words.
We are going to join this sage honoured by the people of the world and ever engaged in the welfare of the virtuous. This augurs well for us.
O noble, handsome Lakshmana, I will spend the rest of the exile in this forest in the worship of the great sage Agastya.
The gods along with gandharvas, siddhas and great sages always serve Agastya, observing discipine in their food habits.
This sage is such type that he (his spiritual power) will not allow a liar or a cruel man or a deceitful or lustful  or wicked person to thrive here.
Here gods, yakshas, nagas and birds live, following the righteous path and observing discipline in food habits.
Here great souls like sages and siddhas gave up the ghost and with renewed bodies left for heaven on aerochariot resembling the Sun (in brightness).
Worshipped by benevolent beings, the gods here bestow on them the status of demigods or of the immortals or several kinds of kingdoms.
Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama,  entered the hermitage of Agastya and met one of his disciples and said to him these words :
The valiant eldest son of  king Dasaratha has come along with his wife Sita to see the sage.
I am his younger brother Lakshmana, his wellwisher and faithful devotee if you have at all heard about me.
By the command of our father, we have entered this dense forest and desire to see the   divine sire. Please report.
The ascetic heard Lakshmana, and saying, 'let it be so', entered the firesanctuary to report.
Having promptly entered, Agastya's favourite disciple with folded hands reported as he was told by Lakshmana about Rama's arrival to the great sage who was armed with the inviolable powers of penance :
Rama and Lakshmana, the two sons of Dasaratha along with Sita, wife of Rama, have arrived at the hermitage.
Both the subduers of enemies  have come here now to see and serve your Holiness. You may order what is to be done next.
Having heard from the disciple about the arrival of Rama, Lakshmana and great daughter of the king of Videha the sage said :
It is good fortune that Rama has come here after a long time to see me. I was longing for his arrival.
Go quickly and with due hospitality conduct Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana into my presence. Why was he not ushered in so long?
'So be it ' said the disciple respectfully with folded palms in response to what the great sage, knower of dharma, commanded.
Then the disciple in a state of excitement came out of the hermitage and said to Lakshmana, 'Where is Rama? Let him come himself to see the sage'.
Then Lakshmana reached the entrance of the hermitage with the disciple  and showed  Rama of the Kakutstha race and Sita, daughter of Janaka .
The disciple humbly reported Agastya's words and ushered him in with befitting hospitality.
Then Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the hermitage, watching herds of quietly moving deer (undisturbed by their entry).
Rama saw at the hermitage, the places (altars) of Brahma, Visnu, Agni (firegod), Indra, Sun, Moon, Bhaga, Kubera, Dhata (supreme spirit), Vidhata (creator Brahman), Vayu (Windgod), Ananta (great serpentking),  Gayatri, Vasu Pasahasta, Varuna, Kartikeya and Dharma .
Thereafter surrounded by the disciples the sage came out. Rama saw him coming in front of the effulgent sages.
The valiant Rama said to Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, O Lakshmana, sage Agastya is coming out. By virtue of his noble appearance, I know this sage to be a great treasuretrove of penances.
Having said so, the mightyarmed Rama, the scorcher of enemies, grasped the feet of Agastya who was shining like the Sun.
Then righteous Rama with Sita, the princess of Videha, and Lakshmana offered respects with folded palmsstanding.
Agastya received Rama by offering him seat and water, enquired about his wellbeing  and said: Please be seated,
After giving oblations to the fire, and  providing respectful offerings, the sage worshipped the guests according to the tradition of hermits and served them food.
And then the great sage Agastya, knower of dharma  first took his seat and addressed Rama, an export in the knowledge of dharma, seated with folded palms.
O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, only  after offering oblations to the Firegod, a guest should be worshipped with water etc. Otherwise the host will have to eat his own flesh in the other world like a false witness.
You are king of all the worlds, a follower of dharma, a great warrior worthy of worship and an esteemed self. O Rama you are such a dear guest come to me.
Having said this to Rama, (the sage) honoured him by offering fruits, roots, flowers and other things as desired. He then said to Rama once again:
O best among men  this divine bow studded with gold and gems  belongs to Visnu and designed by Visvakarma. This excellent, unfailing arrow, bright like the Sun, was given to me by Brahma.
These two quivers filled fully with sharp inexhaustible arrows, shining like flames of fire and this sword adorned with gold and this big silver sheath were given to me by Indra.
In ancient times Visnu killed the demons in a battle with this bow and brought back the glittering prosperity for the gods.
O bestower of honour, receive this bow, the two quivers, the sword and the arrow for your victory just like Indra accepts the thunderbolt.
The luminous lord Agastya, having said this, gave all the excellent weapons to Rama. And continued :   इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वादशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
O Rama ,I am pleased. I wish you well. I am glad that both of you have come here with Sita to pay respect to me.
Both of you are tired due to the journey. It is evident that Sita, daughter of Janaka, is anxious (to rest).
Even though delicate, Sita never feels discouraged by difficulties. She has come to the forest full of obstacles, since she is motivated by her love for her husband.
O Rama, help Sita enjoy herself in whatever manner she likes. By following you into the forest, she has accomplished the most difficult task৷৷
O Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty from the beginning of the creation women, by nature,  keep the husband company when all goes well and give them up when hard times come.
Women are fickle like lightning, sharp like weapons and fast like Garuda or the windgod.
Your wife is free from such blemishes. She is praiseworthy and worthy of mention as an example just like the revered Arundhati.
O Rama, subduer of enemies the place where you reside along with Lakshmana and Vaidehi will look adorned, indeed.
Thus addressed, Rama held his palms together and said politely to the sage shining like fire:
I consider myself blessed and favoured by a great sage like you, bestower of boons as you have been pleased with me, my brother and my life.
Direct me to a place with water and dense forest where we can build an ashram and live happily.
On hearing the words of Rama, Agastya, the best among the sages, coolheaded and righteous, thought a while and uttered these words coolly :
O dear two yojanas away is a place wellknown as Panchavati, a beautiful resort with many roots, fruits, plenty of water and many animals.
Reaching there, you wikk build a hermitage with Lakshmana and enjoy your life given to the fulfilment of the pledge to the father.
O Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas  much of the period of exile king Dasaratha had assigned has passed. You will fulfil your promise and live happily in the kingdom.
O Rama, joy of the Raghu family with the eldest son like you, your father is blessed and liberated like king Yayati.
O sinless one, I have kown all these facts about you by the power of penance and love for Dasaratha.
I know your heart by virtue of my penance. I, therefore, ask you to proceed to Panchavati, after ensuring your stay here with me in this penancegrove for the time being.
O Raghava, that forest tract is delightful and beautiful. It is not far away(from here). Maithili (Sita) will enjoy her stay there.
O longarmed Rama,that place has plenty of roots and fruits. It is a solitary, holy and beautiful place teeming with various kinds of birds. Sita will enjoy her stay in the vicinity of river Godavari.
O Rama, while staying with your wife, you will look after the ascetics living there since you are capable of giving protection.
O valiant Rama look at the great forest of madhuka trees. Walk north to the forest till you see a great banyan tree.
Then climb the elevated ground not very far from the mountain. There is the wellknown Panchavati with forests, ever in full bloom.
Thus addressed by Agastya,  Rama with Lakshmana paid respects to the sage wedded to truth and took leave of him.
Both of them worshipped the feet of sage Agastya, and proceeded to Panchavati with his permission.
Both the princes, unafraid of battles, held their bows, tied the quivers and carefully proceeded towards Panchavati along the path suggested by the sage.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयोदशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On the way to Panchavati, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, met a vulture with a huge body and fearful strength.
Seeing the bird on the banyan tree, venerable Rama and Lakshmana mistook him for a demon and enquired who he was.
With a sweet, pleasing, and gentle voice he said to both of them, O dear know me to be a friend of your father.
Rama knew he was a friend of his father. So he enquired in a cool, composed voice his name and his lineage.
On hearing Rama's words, the bird started narrating the origin of all beings including his own family:
O mightyarmed Rama hear from me while I am telling you about the lords of creation from the very beginning.
O Rama among the lords of all beings the first was Kardama, the next was Vikritha, followed by Sesha, Samsrya Bahuputra, Sthanu, Mareechi, Atri and mighty Kratu, Pulastya, Angirasa, Pracheta, similarly Pulaha and Daksha.Following them were Vivasvan, Arishtanemi and the very glorious Kasyapa who was the last ruler.
O glorious Rama it is wellknown that Daksha, the creator had sixty daughters of great fame.
Out of them(daughters of Daksha) Kasyapa married eight women of beautiful waist called Aditi, Diti, Danu also Kalika,Tamra, Krodhavasa, Anala and Manu.
Kasyapa, pleased with them said to his young wives, Beget sons of my stature who can rule over the three worlds.
O best of men, O longarmed Rama while Aditi, Diti and Kalika seriously considered his advice, the rest of the wives did not.
O Rama, subduer and scorcher of enemies to Aditi were born twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and two Asvins, thirtythree deities in all.
O dear Rama, Diti bore glorious sons called Daityas and this earth with all the forests and seas belonged to them.
O subduer of enemies, to Danu was born Hayagriva and to Kalika, Naraka and Kalaka.
To Tamra were born, Krounchi, Bhasi, Syeni, Dhrutharashtri and Suki. Altogether they were five beautiful young maids famous in the world.
Krounchi gave birth to owls, Bhasi to Bhasa birds, Synei to bright hawks and vultures, Dhrutharashtri to swans and chakravakas with sweet notes.
Dhrutharashtri, a female bird of great lustre gave birth to chakravakas too. Suki gave birth to Nata and from Nata, Vinata was born. Be blessed, O Rama
O Ramato Krodhavasa were born Mrugi, Mrugamanda, Hari, Bhadramada, Mathangi, Sardooli, Sweta, Surabhi and Surasa, Kadruva and endowed with all virtues.
O best of men, all kinds of animals were born of Mrugi.To Mrugamanda were born bears and chamara (a different kind of deer).
To Hari were born lions, and swiftmoving monkeys and to Bhadramada, a daughter by name Iravati.
O bull among men Matangi gave birth to elephants.The mighty elephant Airavata who became the lord of the world was born to Iravati.
O Rama, Sarduli gave birth to tigers and playful, roundbodied monkeys called Golangula and Sweta delivered elephants as sons for guarding the eight quarters.
Surabhi gave birth to Rohini and Gandharvi,the two famous daughters. May you be happy, Rama
O Rama Rohini procreated cows, and Gandharvi, horses as offsprings. Surasa delivered cobras and Kadru, ordinary serpents.
O Rama, bull among men Manu procreated brahmins, kshatriyas, vaisyas and sudras all famed human beings.
Anala (wife of Kasyapa) procreated trees with sacred fruits. Vinata was the granddaughter of Suki, and Kahdruva and Surasa were her sisters.
Kadhru produced a thousandhooded serpent(Adisesha) who held the whole earth on his head and Vinata, two sons, Garuda and Aruna.
I am born to Aruna and my elder brother is Sampati. O subduer of enemies, know me as Jatayu, son of Syeni.
If you so desire I will be helpful to you in guarding your hut. O dear, it is a difficult forest full of wild animals and demons. When you and Lakshmana are away I will protect Sita.
Rama worshipped  Jatayu and bending down, embraced him. He heard from him again and again several events relating to Jatayu's  friendship with his father.
Entresting the protection of Sita, the princess of Mithila, to that strong vulture,  Jatayu, and accompanied by Lakshmana Rama went to Panchavati wishing to destroy the enemies like fire burning the moths.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामयणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुर्दशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On reaching Panchavati, which was full of various vicious animals, Rama said to Lakshmana, his brother who was glowing like  fire:
O handsome one, following the directions of the great sage, we have arrived at Panchavati, a place full of blossoming trees.
O Lakshmana cast your eyes all around the forest for a suitable place (for building a hermitage).  Indeed, you are good at judging things.
Look, O Lakshmana  for a place to the liking of Sita, a place where there is water source nearby  where both of us can enjoy. Find a beautiful location where the surrounding forest is beautiful and where faggots, flowers, water and kusa grass are available at hand.
Having been thus instructed by Rama, Lakshmana said with folded palms in the presence of Sita:
O Rama, I shall be dependent on you, even if I live for a hundred years. You only need to indicate a beautiful place of your choice.
Rama was pleased with the words of great Lakshmana. Deliberating over it, he agreed upon a site suitable in all respects.
Having come to a beautiful spot suitable for the asram, Rama took both the hands of  Lakshmana in his own and said:
This place is level, surrounded by beautiful trees in full bloom. O handsome one, you may build the hermitage here.
There, not very far, is a beautiful lotustank shining like the Sun, fragrant with lotuses.
As said by the selfrealised soul, sage Agastya, this Godavari is beautiful, surrounded by trees with flowers in bloom, filled with flocks of swans, ducks and ruddy geese.
O handsome one, neither far nor near are seen tall mountains and flowering trees and herds of deer. Their numerous caves echo with sounds of peacocks.
These mountains, with streaks of minerals like gold, silver and copper forming decorative designs, look beautiful like colourful windows, and appear like huge elephants.
The place is covered with  sal and palmyrah trees including mango, jackfruit, dates, kadamba, punnaga, ashoka, champak, tilaka, ketaka, sandalwood, spandan, dhava, asvakarna parnasha, khadira, sami, kimsuka and patala trees. It is full of wild paddy, flowering bushes and creepers that run on the ground.
This is a holy place fit for sacrifice. There are many animals and birds here.Hence we will reside here with Jatayu.
Thus directed by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana, destroyer  of enemy warriors, soon built a hermitage for his brother.
Lakshmana who was quick to act dug the clay with nippers, planted long bamboo poles, put branches of sami trees across and tied them with strong ropes. He spread kusa and kasa grass and leaves on the levelled ground. He built a beautiful, spacious and nice residence for Rama.
Lakshmana then went to river Godavari, had his bath, and returned with some lotuses.
Lakshmana offered oblation of flowers, invoked peace as per tradition (before occupying a newly made home) and showed Rama the cottage he had built.
Rama and Sita saw the beautiful hermitage built by Lakshmana, and expressed much happiness over the leafthatched cottage.
Deeply pleased with Lakshmana, he hugged him tightly and said those loving words :
O my master, you have done a great task for which I have given you what I could give at the moment a hug.
O Lakshmana with a son like you who can understand others' feelings, who has a sense of gratitude and a sense of duty my father is not dead yet.
Rama who was an enhancer of fortunes and who had his senses under control said thus to Lakshmana and lived happily there in that place filled with fruits.
Righteous Rama, served by Lakshmana, and Sita lived there for some time like a god in heaven. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चदशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While the great self Rama  lived happily there, autumn passed and dear winter set in.
Once Rama, delight of the Raghu race, went to the beautiful river Godavari for ablution in the early hours of the morning.
While valiant Lakshmana, walking behind Sita who was carrying a pitcher in her hand bent down a little and told Rama thus:
O sweetspeaking brother, the season which is dear to you has arrived. It appears the auspicious year is going to be embellished with this season.
People feel frozen with fog, and water is no more enjoyable. The earth is full of crops and fire is so agreeable.
Pious men offer their libations of the first crop at Agnistoma sacrifice and thereby please their manes and get rid of their sins.
People in the countryside with their desires satisfied obtain abundant cow's milk at this time. Rulers of the earth are out on their expedition with a desire for victory.
As the Sun has resorted to the direction (south) that serves the god of death, the north devoid of (the Sun) shines like a woman without the vermilion mark on the forehead.
Presently with the Sun far away, the Himalayas abounding in snow has naturally justified its name.
The days are enjoyable at noon as it is pleasant to move about during this time since the sun is not scorching. But the shade and water seem to be unfortunate (as they are not liked by any one.
The days will be frostsmitten. The Sun will also be mild. Due to heavy dewfall the weather will be cold with the blowing of the wind. Forests will be empty (as no animals would be seen moving around.)
At this time people do not sleep under the open sky. With the month of Pushya approaching, nights feel cool and look red due to frost. They prolong into three yamas.
With the radiance of the Sun dimmed, with its orb reddened by frost, the moon does not shine clear like a mirror blurred with breath.
On a fullmoon night the beams of the moon faded by forest look pale, dull like Sita scorched by the heat of the Sun.
The west wind which by nature feels cold at this time blows doubly cold, hit by snow.
The snowcold forest terrains are fertile with barley and wheat crops. As the Sun rises the swans and kraunchas produce pleasing notes.
The tops of rice crops shining like gold resemble the flowers of datepalm.The fields full of ripe paddy bending a little (under the weight of grains) look delightful.
The Sun risen at the distant horizon looks like the Moon, his lengthening rays covered with snow and dew.
The heat of the Sun which we do not feel in the forenoon is comfortable during midday when the Sun shines slightly reddish white on earth.
As the miadows are wet with dewdrops, the land looks delightful with mild Sunlight  shining on the surface.
The wild tusker, extremely thirsty, touches the clean, cold water joyfully, but immediately withdraws its trunk unable to bear the cold.
Just as inefficient warriors do not enter the warfield, aquatic birds sitting near water do not venture to take a plunge into it.
The flowerless forest ranges appear as if they are asleep, enveloped in the darkness of frost and  snow .
Now the rivers are not visible as the waters are covered with vapour. They are only inferred through the cackling of swans and the sands of the bank moistened with dewdrops.
Due to snowfall, mildness of the Sun, and coldness (of weather) even the water flowing from the mountain top is not generally tasty.
The lotuses in the tank  no more shine (bright) as they are decayed by age, their filaments and pericarps withered with only stalks remaining.
At this time, righteous Bharata, the best among men, with his devotion to you must be sadly performing penance at his residence.
Giving up his kingdom, honour and pleasures of many kinds, Bharata will be living like an ascetic, sleeping on the ground in cold weather, his food under restriction.
At this time, Bharata,  accompanied by his subjects, must be daily going to river Sarayu for ablution.
How can Bharata who was brought up in luxury, who is delicate, and deserves all comfort, take a dip in river Sarayu (in cold morning) ?
He has a blue complexion, a pair of eyes like lotus petals, a thin waist and long arms. He is selfrestrained, softspoken, sweettempered and truthful. He knows his duty and maintains a low profile. A subduer  of enemies, he is heroic and great. Such Bharata has given up the diverse pleasures of life and has surrendered himself to you with all his soul.
Although you dwell in the forest, your great brother Bharata has won the kingdom of heaven by faithfully adopting your asceticism.
The saying that men follow mother's path but not the path of the father, has been disproved by Bharata.
How could mother Kaikeyi, who has a husband like Dasaratha and a noble son like Bharata, be so wicked by nature ?
When pious Lakshmana said thus to Rama out of his love for him, Rama replied, unable to tolerate the words of censure against mother (Kaikeyi) :
O dear, Kaikeyi, our second mother, is never to be criticised like that. You may, however, speak more of Bharata, the lord of the Iksvakus.
Even though I have made up my mind to dwell in the forest and keep my vow, my love for Bharata makes me waver like a child (Rama does not want Bharata to suffer on his account).
I remember his dear, sweet, ambrosial  words, soothing to the heart and pleasing to the mind.
O enhancer of joy of the Raghus  when shall I meet great Bharata, brave Satrughna and you all together?
Expressing his grief in such manner, Rama reached Godavari where he took his bath with his brother and Sita.
And then poised, they offered libations of water to their forefathers and gods and prayer to the rising Sun.
Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana,Rama finished his bath in the river.He looked splendid like Lord Rudra followed by Nandi and the daughter of the king of  the mountains (Parvati). इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षोडशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Ablution over, Rama, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana, went back from the bank of the river Godabari to their hermitage.
On reaching the hermitage, Rama and Lakshmana performed the forenoon rituals and entered the leafthatched cottage.
Honoured by the ascetics , Rama  stayed there peacefully with brother Lakshmana, discussing diverse matters (from time to time).
Longarmed Rama seated with Sita in the cottage, appeared like the Moon in conjunction with constellation Chitra.
While Rama was thus seated, engrossed in conversation, there incidentally appeared a demoness.
Surpanakha, sister of the tenheaded demon (Ravana) approached Rama shining like a god.
The demoness was infatuated with Rama,  whose chest was like that of a lion, who was strongarmed, who had a glowing face, pleasing to the eyes, who walked with the gait of an elephant, whose hair was matted,  who was gentle and strong who was, endowed with royal traits, who had a blue lotuslike complexion, who was handsome as the god of love, and who resembled Indra.
Rama's face was lovely, Surpanakha's was hideous. Rama had a slender waist, she had a huge belly. His eyes were large,  hers were deformed. His hair was black and beautiful, hers was coppercoloured. He was lovely in appearance, she was ugly. His voice was sweet, hers was shrill. He was young, she was dreadfully old. He was positive, she was perverted. Rama was wellbehaved, she was wicked. Rama was just and loving while she was overcome by lust.  (This) demoness said to Rama :
O Rama you are wearing matted hair like an ascetic, but living with your wife and holding bow and arrows. What brings you to this place haunted by demons ? You should tell me the truth ?
Thus asked by the demoness Surpanakha,  Rama, scorcher of foes began telling her everything due to his simplemindedness.
To Rama untruth is never acceptable at the hermitage and especially in the presence of a woman.
(Rama replied) There was a king named Dasaratha who was mighty like the gods. I am his eldest son known among the people as Rama.
Here is Lakshmana , my younger brother, who always follows me . And this  is the daughter of the king of Videha and my wife, wellknown as Sita.
I have come here, commanded by the king, my father and mother.Intending to obey the orders of my father, and impelled by duty to  establish righteousness I have come  to reside here.
I wish to know who you are. Tell me who your kins are. With lovely limbs you do not appear to be a demoness.
Tell me truly what you have come here for. Having heard the words of Rama and overtaken by passion, the demoness said:
My name is Surpanakha. I am a demoness who can assume any form at will, I move in this forest alone, unleashing a reign of terror.
My brother is Ravana, son of Visrava, and lord of all demons. You have heard his name I suppose.
Kumbhakarna is another brother of mine. He is very strong. He is always in deep sleep. Vibhisna another brother. He is righteous free from  any demoniac trait. My other two brothers are Khara and Dusana who are wellknown heroes of war.
Setting them aside, I came here, as soon as I saw you. You are the finest among men and I am here wishing you to be my husband.
I have influence over others, I have capacity to move wherever I want. Be my husband forever. What will you do with Sita?
She is ugly, deformed, unsuitable for you. I  am alone  fit for you. Look upon me as your wife.
I will devour your brother along with this disfigured, unchaste and fearful lady with a flat belly.
O darling, thereafter you can keep wandering with me in this Dandaka forest, enjoying the beauty of the mountain tops and forests.
Thus addressed, Rama, skilled in speech, laughed and started speaking to that woman of bewitching eyes.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तदशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
To  Surpanakha bound by the noose of passion Rama with a smile replied in a clear, lucid manner:
O lady I am married and here is my wife who is dear to me. To be a cowife to some one is indeed painful for people like you.
Here is my younger brother Lakshmana. He is a man of good conduct, good look, valiant and virtuous. (Besides) he is not with his wife.
He is not with his wife, and is in need of one. He is young, handsome and worthy. He will be an appropriate husband to you.
O  woman of large eyes and fine hips, my brother is fit for you. You will (with him) shine like the radiant Sun on mount Meru. You will enjoy yourself without a cowife. You may approach him.
Thus  told by Rama, the demoness, deluded with lust, left him suddenly, and said to Lakshmana:
With my fine complexion, I will be a suitable wife for you. You can happily wander about in Dandaka forest with me.
Thus addressed by the demoness Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, wellversed in the use of words gave her a befitting reply :
O lotuscomplexioned woman , how can you act as a maid to a slave ? Why do you intend to be so? I am already dependent on my revered brother.
O largeeyed one, you have a clear complexion. You may become the younger wife of my master who is lord of great wealth. And live a happy, fulfilled life.
He will abandon this uglylooking, unchaste, frightening old woman of drooping belly and accept you alone as his wife.
O lady of fair complexion and beautiful hips, which wise man will fall in love with any other female giving up a fine figure like you ?
While Lakshmana was thus making fun of the dreadful, droopingbellied Surpanakha, she presumed his words to be true.
Deluded with passion, Surpanakha said to formidable Rama, the scorcher of foes,  seated in the leafthatched hut along with Sita:
I shall eat up this woman now before your very eyes and I can move about happily with you without a cowife.
While speaking this, Surpanakha, with eyes like flaming amber ran to the fawneyed Sita in great anger like a giant meteor hurtling towards the constellation of Rohini :
Mighty Rama in a rage restrained her who was falling upon Sita like the noose of death, and said to Lakshmana:
O handsome Lakshmana it is not proper to cut jokes with wicked, uncivilized persons. Now see Sita who has somehow survived.
O tiger among men, this uncouth, bigbellied, unchaste and highly passionate demoness deserves to be formed.
Thus instructed (by Rama), powerful Lakshmana took position by the side of Rama, angrily lifted the sword and cut off her nose and ears.
Dreadful Surpanakha with her ears and nose cut off, roared in a hoarse voice and ran away into the forest in the same direction as she came.
The dreadful demoness who thus was disfigured. Drenched in blood, she  thundered like a cloud in rainy season.
Dripping blood profusely, the frightful demoness lifted her arms and entered the great forestroaring.
A disfigured demoness, she fell down like the thunderbolt from the sky on the ground while her fiercelooking brother Khara sat surrounded by demons at Janasthana.
Thereafter the sister of Khara, wild with fear and delusion and drenched in blood, narrated all about the arrival of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in the forest and her disfigurement.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टादशस्सर्ग।।Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Burning with anger to see his sister fallen down disfigured and drenched in blood, Khara enquired:
Get up, give up your confusion and stupefaction. Tell me clearly by whom you have been disfigured like this ?
Who will hurt  an innocent, venomous black serpent and stay away quietly close by for fun with his finger tip?
Who is he who has tied has tied his throat with the noose of death out of ignorance and yet does not know the implications ? Who is he who has caused this injury to you, but does not understand that he has drunk deadly poison.
You have sufficient strength and courage. You are capable of  moving as you like and taking any form at your will. By whom have you been brought to this state and drawn close to death?
Which valiant person among gods, gandharvas, sages and other great people, has disfigured you like this ?
I can see none in this world who can offend me, nor even the thousandeyed Indra among the gods.
Just as the swan drinks only milk from water (mixed with milk), my arrows will (unerringly) drain the life from the enemy's body right now.
Whose foamy, red blood will the earth drink while I strike his vital organs with my arrows in the fight ?
Whose flesh will be eaten by cheerful flocks of (vultures), biting and tearing his body when he is killed by me in the battle ?
Neither gods nor devils nor gandharvas nor even demons will have the power to rescue that hapless creature dragged by me ruthlessly in the battle.
You should tell me as you slowly regain your consciousness which bragart has overpowered you in the forest with his strength.
On hearing her angry brother, Surpanakha replied with words choked with tears:
Here are two young sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, who are gentle, handsome,  strong, with eyes like white lotus, wearing deerskin and bark robes, living on fruits and roots, selfrestrained like ascetics and following the righteous path.
They are kings of the gandharvas with all royal insignia. I was not able to discern whether they are gods or humans.
I saw between them a young, beautiful woman of slender waist, adorned with all kinds of jewels.
I have been subjected to this state of an orphan unfaithful woman by both of them for the sake of that lady.
I wish to drink the foamy blood of that crooked woman and of both the brothers slain on the battle front.
O dear  this is my first wish and you must fulfil it. I will drink her blood and  of the two brothers, in the battle.
As she was speaking, the inflamed Khara ordered fourteen very strong demons, comparable to Yama, the god of death, to proceed.
Two human beings equipped with weapons, clad in bark robes and deerskin have entered the dreadful Dandaka forest along with a woman of bewitching beauty.
I want you to get  both of them along with that notorious woman killed. This sister of mine will drink their blood.
O demons quickly go and crush them with your power and fulfil my sister's sincere wish.
Thus commanded, the fourteen demons along with Surpanakha rushed there like windblown clouds.
The nightrangers were unable to crush him(Rama) despite their sharp, glowing weapons  just as wild elephants cannot face all at once the rising flame of the forest fire.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The frightful Surpanakha came to the hermitage of Rama and showed both the brothers and Sita to the demons.
They saw mighty Rama together with Vaidehi and Lakshmana sitting in the leafthatched cottage.
Seeing the demons along with Surpanakha arrive, said the handsome Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty to his brother Lakshmana, who was blazing like fire :
O Lakshmana  stand by Sita for a while. I shall kill these demons who have come here.
Lakshmana heard him and in turn honoured the word of Rama, knower of the self.
Righteous Rama too, lifted up his great bow decked with gold and fastened the string and then said to the demons:
We, Rama and Lakshmana, sons of Dasaratha, are brothers, who have entered the inaccessible Dandaka forest along with Sita.
Feeding on fruits and roots and following the righteous path, we are living in Dandaka forest like ascetics. Why are you torturing us?
I came here equipped with bows, arrows and weapons, asked by ascetics to kill in the battle sinners like you who are offending them.
If you care for your life, you may return, or else, if you please you may remain (die) here, O demons.
At these words, the destroyers of brahmins, the fourteen demons were inflamed. They lifted their spears and spoke:
You have incited the wrath of Khara, our great master for which you will now pay with your life in the fight.
How can you face us alone? We outnumber you? Leave alone fighting, you cannot even stand in front of us.
Come on with daggers and sharpedged spears hurled, you will give up your life,your prowess as well as the bow held in your hand.
Saying these words, the fourteen infuriated demons hurled their spears at invincible Rama.
All the fourteen spears hurled turned into splinters by the same number of golden arrows released by Rama.
Then the effulgent Rama, mighty angry, took fourteen arrows sharpened by stones and glowing like the  Sun.
Rama took the bow, stretched it and aimed at his target, the demons  and sent the arrows as Indra would release the thunderbolt.
Goldfeathered blazing arrows decorated with gold, released by Rama flew fast and pierced the chests of the demons. Drenched in blood they (the arrows) thundered (out of their chests) and  plunged into the earth.
With their hearts split, their bodies drenched in blood, disfigured and lifeless, the demons fell down on earth like trees cut  at the roots.
Seeing the demons fallen on the ground, the demoness wild with anger and fear roared.
Her blood slightly dried up, she came back afflicted to Khara and fell down like a sallaki tree, its sap oozing.
Missing
Then desperately screaming and shedding tears with a sad face beside her brother, she roared again and again.
When Surpanakha saw the demons fall dead on the battleground, she ran to Khara,her brother and told in detail about the death of the demons.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे विंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Seeing Surpanakha collapse, Khara said in clear terms about the unfortunate situation she had created:
The valiant demons who feed on blood have been commissioned for your pleasure. Why are you crying again?
They are loyal and faithful to me. They are always my wellwishers. Even when attacked, they cannot be killed. They never fail to carry out my orders.
I wish to know what makes you lament and roll on the ground like a serpent and hissing?
When I am here like a lord to protect you, why do you weep like an orphan? Get up. Give up your anxiety. Be not afraid.
Thus consoled by Khara, invincible Surpanakha wiped her tearful eyes and said to her brother:
My ears and nose sliced off, drenched with blood, I came to you and you pacified me.
O warrior  you had sent, out of anger, fourteen demons to put an end to Rama along with Lakshmana in order to please me.
The demons who went with spears in their hands were killed, their hearts pierced by  Rama's arrows.
Seeing the powerful demons collapse on the ground in a moment's time through Rama's action, I was frightened.
O demon  I am scared and sad. To me everything looks frightening. I, therefore, seek refuge in you.
I am drowned in a vast sea of sorrow where crocodiles in the form of distress reside. It is full of rows of waves of fright. Why do you not save me?
The demons who live on flesh, who came following me fell down on earth and lay dead,  shot by the sharp arrows of Rama.
O demon  if you have compassion for me or for the demons, if you have the power and energy to face Rama, kill the enemy of the demons living in Dandaka forest.
If now you do not kill that Rama, my enemy, O shameless one, I will give up my life in your very presence.
Instinctively I can foresee that you and your army do not have the capability to encounter that great Rama in a fight.
You call yourself a hero, yet are not able to kill two humans like Rama and Lakshmana. Your claim to heroism is false. You are not a hero at all.
O demon  you are a disgrace to the family. If you have power or energy, kill that Rama dwelling in Dandaka forest.
You have little strength and less heroism. You with your relations should immediately leave Janasthana. What kind of position do you have here?
Let down by the brilliance of Rama, son of Dasaratha, you will be soon destroyed. He is mighty and his brother who has disfigured me is very valiant.
Overcome by sorrow, the bigbellied demoness cried  in several ways and being very sad started beating her chest with both hands.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकविंशस्सर्गः।Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Ashamed and accused thus in the presence of the demons, the valiant Khara spoke to Surpanakha in harsh words:
Like the overslowing salt sea water, I am unable to contain this my excessive anger arising out of your insult.
Rama is a shortlived human. I do not care for his valour. His life span will be shortened (he will be killed) now for his own misdeeds.
Restrain your tears and your anxieties I will send Rama along with his brother to the abode of Yama.
With his life ebbing out, killed by my axe in the fight, you will drink today, O demoness, Rama's red, hot blood.
On hearing the words that came out of Khara's mouth, she was pleased. And in stupidity began praising her brother once again as the best of demons.
Khara, accused by her earlier and admired again, said to Dusana, chief of army:
There are fourteen thousand demons at my command ready to act according to my will. They are warriors of terrific speed and will not retreat from the fight.
They are of the colour of the dark blue cloud, dreadful and merciless, strong and powerful fighters who roam about forturing people.
O handsome one, get them all, powerful like tigers, demons with large countenances, mighty and arragant, ready (for the fight).
O goodnatured one, get my chariot, bows and arrows, wonderful swords of different kinds and sharp missiles ready quickly.
O expert in warfare, I wish to lead those great warriors of Paulasthya family, to kill that immodest Rama.
While Khara was speaking thus, Dusana reported that a huge chariot of the colour of the Sun yoked with good horses of variegated hues stood ready.
Then the impatient Khara mounted the chariot that looked like the peak of mount Meru. It was decorated with pure gold, had golden wheels, poles studded with vaidurya. The carriage of the chariot was engraved with golden figures of fishes, flowers, trees, the Sun, stars, flocks of auspicious birds, flags and swords. Shining with small bells, it was yoked to fine horses.
The demons of terrific prowess surounded Khara and Dusana and stood by, when they saw both of them mounting the chariot.
Khara mounted the chariot, saw the demons holding great weapons, wearing dreadful shields and holding flags, and ordered them to march.
Then the army of the demons wearing dreadful shields, holding weapons and flags, and making a loud noise started in great speed from Janasthanam.
The fourteen thousand demons loyal to the wishes of Khara, took in their hands, maces, piercing weapons, spears, sharp axes used in battle, swords, wheels, splinters, iron clubs, powerful missiles, dreadful iron bars of giant size, bows made of bamboo, clubs and frightening weapons like thunderbolt (of Indra) and  departed from Janasthana.
Khara's chariot moved a bit behind the army of demons of frightening prowess who rushed forward to attack (Rama).
Knowing the mind of Khara, the charioteer hastened the horses of the colourful  chariot decorated with pure gold.
Spurred by the charioteer, the chariot of Khara, the slayer of enemies, produced a rattle that filled all four quarters and the intermediate directions.
Khara in extreme anger hastened, like Yama, to slay his enemy. He roared loudly like a cloud raining hail stones and impelled his charioteer to speed up. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वालल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वाविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
As the army marched from there (Janasthana) a huge dark cloud of the colour of an ass rained dreadful inauspicious water, red as blood.
The swift horses yoked to the chariot stumbled casually while galloping on the plane highway sprinkled with flowers.
A dark ring, bloodred in colour appeared on the border of the Sun's orb, dark in the middle. This phenomenon of the Sun appeared like a ring of moving charcoal covering the Sun.
A huge vulture, frightening to look at flew up and sat on top of the flag on the staff of gold.
Flesheating beasts and birds flocked at Janasthana producing a cacophony.
The dreadful jackals making ghastly howls turning towards the illuminated direction and produced frightening sounds indicating inauspicious time for the demons.
The clouds looked like shattered mountains pouring down bloodlike rain which filled the sky and made it appear frighteningly different.
A terrific darkness, spread all over, produced frightening horripilation. Even the four quarters and the intermediary zones were not discernible.
Even before Sunset the twilight looked like a fresh wound. Then wild animals, birds, kankas, jackals and vultures facing towards Khara screeched, indicating danger.
Bad omens that always bring inauspiciousness were a dreadful evidence of what is going to happen. Jackals howled, facing Khara's army with their mouths emitting fire.
The planet Ketu appeared  like an iron beam near the Sun. Although it was not the fullmoon or newmoon day, Rahu eclipsed the Sun. Wind blew hard and the Sun was lustreless.
The stars rose in the sky and glittered like fireflies even before night arrived. The fishes and the aquatic birds in the lotusponds hid themselves under water.  Lotuses dried up in tanks and the trees stood bereft of flowers and fruits.
Although there was no wind, dust rose like a brown cloud and the sarika birds sang (vichi kuchi) thoughtlessly.
Dreadful to watch were the thunderstorms and the meteors that dropped down from the sky. The earth trembled all over with mountains, groves and forests.
While the intelligent and courageous Khara was seated on the chariot and shouting, his left shoulder shook violently and throat throttled.
While watching all this, his eyes brimmed with tears. His forehead ached. Yet he was too deluded to beat a retreat.
Looking at these dreadful, horripilating occurrences Khara laughed and said to the demons:
Valiant and strong, I do not take seriously these terrifying omens boding calamity  just as a strong man does not care for the weak.
With my sharp arrows I can even bring down the stars from the sky. If angered, I can cause mortality to the god of death.
I do not wish to return, without killing with my sharp arrows that Rama who is proud of his strength and his brother Lakshmana.
Let my sister be satisfied by drinking the blood of both Rama and Lakshmana on whose account this adversity has come.
I have never faced defeat in wars, and all of you have seen it with your eyes. I am not telling you a lie.
When angry, I can kill even (Indra) the wielder of the thunderbolt, rider of the intoxicated Airavata and lord of the gods. What to speak of these two petty humans?
Fallen into the deathtrap, the great army of the demon, felt very happy on hearing Khara roaring.
Great souls like sages, gods, gandharvas, and siddhas including celestial bards assembled to see the battle.
Holy men assembled and uttered benedictions, saying, 'let there be wellbeing for the cows and brahmins associated with men of pious deeds in all the (three) worlds.
'Let Rama conquer the descendants of Paulasthya in the war like Visnu, the wielder of the wheel had defeated great demons'.
The great ascetics were talking thus and more. The gods waiting eagerly on heavenly chariots saw the army of the demons whose life span was shortened (who were doomed to death).
Seeing Khara, their chief on the chariot driving fast, the army of demons too marched forward.
Surrounded by twelve valiant warriors like Syenagami, Pruthugreeva, Yagnasatru, Vihangama, Durjaya, Karaviraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghmali, Mahamali, Sarpasya and Rudhirasana, Khara proceeded.
Similarly Dusana proceeded with four  Mahakapali, Sthulaksha, Pramathi and Trisira  around him.
The mighty, swiftfooted army of valiant demons surrounded the princes (Rama and Lakshmana) all on a sudden like the planets around the Sun and the Moon.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयोविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Khara endowed with malicious might was marching towards the hermitage, Rama and his brother saw the same omens of impending calamity the demon had seen.
When Rama saw the most dreadful, horripilating phenomena foreboding calamity, he said to Lakshmana:
O longarmed Lakshmana see these calamitous phenomena that forebode mass destruction of men and demons.
These rumbling clouds, brownishred like the colour of a donkey,  are moving about in the sky showering streams of blood.
O Lakshmana all my arrows are smoking and this goldplated bow welcomes me to war.
The way the forestbirds are screeching makes me foresee danger and makes survival doubtful.
A mass destruction of life is going to take place. There is no doubt about it. O brave Lakshmana my right shoulder trembles again and again, indicating the defeat of the enemy. Your beaming visage presages victory.
O Lakshmana, while preparing for war, those whose faces look pale are, for sure, going to die.
A dreadful roar of demons and the loud sound of wardrums beaten by the wicked demons are heard.
A wise man who apprehends danger or one who desires his own good should plan his defence even before the onset of danger.
Therefore, take shelter along with Sita in the inaccessible mountain cave, overgrown with trees, ready with your bow and arrows.
O dear, I do not like you to oppose this word of honour. You must touch my feet and go without delay.
You are valiant and strong. There is no doubt that you can kill all these demons. But I desire to kill them.
Thus ordered by Rama, Lakshmana took the arrows and the bow and accompanied by Sita took shelter in the inaccessible cave.
With Lakshmana and Sita inside the cave, Rama heaved his shield, saying, Oh the work is accomplished.
Adorned with the shield, Rama shone like smokeless fire rising in darkness.
Valiant Rama lifted the huge bow and arrows and stood there, filling the directions with the twangs of his bow.
Then the gods along with gandharvas, siddhas, and celestial bards assembled there, wishing to witness the war.
Great ascetics of the world, distinguished brahmarsis, accomplishers of pious deeds assembled and said to one another:
'Let there be wellbeing for the cows, brahmins, and all the worlds. Let Rama, the scion of the Raghu race, conquer the Paulastyas (demons) in war like lord Visnu, wielder of the disc, who defeated the most powerful demons'.
Thus looking at one another they discussed among themselves how there can be war between the righteous Rama fighting singlehanded on the one hand and the fourteen thousand demons, performers of terrific deeds, on the other.
Rajarsis, siddhas, great brahmins with their clan and gods on the celestial chariots waited to see the war whetted with curiosity.
Seeing Rama standing on the war front, engrossed and radiating heroic lustre, all beings were alarmed.
Rama, who is unwearied in action and who is of an incomparable (lovely) form, looked ferocious like the wielder of Pinaka (Lord Siva).
Then appeared on all sides the wellequipped army of demons raising deep sounds with dreadful shields, weapons and banners.
The forest was filled with tumultuous sounds of the warriors roaring like lions,  shouting at one another, stretching the bowstrings constantly, yawning, proclaiming loudly and beating the drums.
The ferocious animals of the forest got frightened and ran away to silent spots without looking back.
The fierce army, deep like the sea, equipped with various missiles approached Rama.
Rama, wellversed in warfare, cast his eyes on all sides to see the army of Khara that had come prepared for war.
Rama stretched the formidable bow and lifted the arrows from his quiver to kill the demons and assumed intense anger.
Rama stood burning in anger like the fire of the doom's day. It was difficult even to look at him. Seeing him full of glow even the sylvan deities ran away.
Rama in anger looked like Lord Siva ready to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha.
Seeing Rama flashing (in anger) and standing on the warfront all creatures ran away frightened.
The army of demons equipped with blazing armour, bows and banners appeared like a mass of blue clouds at Sunrise. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुर्विंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Khara accompanied by his pilot party arrived at the hermitage of Rama, the destroyer of enemies and saw him in fury, standing ready with his bow.
On seeing Rama, Khara held his terribly twanging bow and arrow, stood facing him, and ordered the charioteer to drive towards him.
Commanded by Khara, the charioteer also urged the horses towards the mightyarmed Rama standing alone and wielding the bow.
Seeing Khara attacking (Rama) all the demon ministers surrounded him  roaring.
Seated on a chariot in the midst of the demons, Khara looked like the rising Mars in the middle of the stars.
Khara struck Rama of immeasurable prowess with a thousand arrows and roared loudly.
Thereafter all the infuriated demons showered on invincible Rama, wielder of a fierce bow, many kinds of weapons.
Overtaken by anger, the demons continuously hurled at Rama hammers, spears, spikes, barbed missiles, swords and battleaxes.
Very powerful demons like huge clouds roared, eager to kill Rama in war. They ran forward on chariots, horses and tall elephants, looking like  mountain tops.
The battalions of demons sent down streams of arrows on Rama just like clouds  downpour on mountains.
Surrounded by the terrible demons Rama appeared like Lord Siva at dusk with hosts of his retinues arounds.
Rama resisted the weapons released by the demons like the sea, the inflow of river waters.
Rama remained unhurt like a great mountain struck by many glowing thunderbolts. He felt no pain even though his limbs were hit by the dreadful weapons.
Wounded all over the body, bleeding through the wounds caused by weapons, Rama looked like the evening Sun covered with clouds.
Seeing Rama left alone surrounded by many thousands of demons, the gods, ghandarvas and siddhas became very sad.
Thereafter Rama, mighty angry, bent his bow and released hundreds and thousands of unfeathered arrows.
As if sporting, Rama discharged the arrows attached with herons' feathers. The arrows were inescapable, unbearable like that of Yama's staff, that went straight without missing the target.
The arrows like the noose of the god of death released by Rama on the enemy army easily destroyed the lives of the demons.
Rama's arrows pierced the bodies of the demons and drenched in blood, they, looking like burning fire, shone in the sky.
From Rama's bow bent into a cirle, countless fierce arrows able to take the lives of demons were released.
In war Rama cut asunder the bows, flag tops, armour and heads of demons, their shoulders and thighs that were like the trunks of elephants, in their hundreds and thousands.
He killed horses with golden armours yoked to the chariots along with charioteers, elephants along with riders, the cavalry along with their horses and infantry and sent them all to the abode of death.
The bodies of the demons torn into pieces by the very sharp iron arrows and by the arrows called vikarni, they cried and shouted aloud in pitiable voices.
Just like the dried up forest burnt by the fire, the army was totally destroyed by Rama's arrows that pierced into the vital parts of the soldiers.
A few warriors of fierce strength approached Rama and hurled at him very powerful weapons, spears, swords and axes.
Strongarmed Rama attacked them with his arrows and cut off their heads and took their lives.
The heads, armour and bows fell down broken on the ground like trees in the wind gererated by Garuda's wings.
The rest of the demons hit by the arrows ran desperate towards Khara for refuge.
Pacifying them all, Dusana regathered them again and ran towards Rama like an angry Yama rushing towards Rudra.
Under Dusana's protection, all of them felt relieved from fear and, carrying sal and palm trees and stones as weapons, advanced towards Rama again.
Holding spears, hammers and bows in their hands, the mighty demons rained on Rama weapons like arrows, trees and stones.
The thrilling, fierce, horrifying and horripilating battle again ensued betwen Rama and the demons.
As the infuriated demons again hurtled towards Rama, filling the quarters and the intermediate directions and raining missiles, Rama aimed at them dazzling gandharvastras, producing a frightening warcry.
Rama then let out from his bow, stretched round, thousands of arrows that covered all the ten quarters.
The demons, though wounded, could not see whereform the terrible arrows came. They only saw Rama shooting the arrows.
Through the darkness created by the arrows that covered the sky and the Sun, Rama looked as though he was vomitting them.
It seemed as if it all happened at the same time, the entire earth filling with demons seriously injured, slain and fallen down on the ground.
There were bodies of demons pierced and torn, thinned and fallen down, destroyed, broken and cut into pieces scattered in their thousands.
Slain thus by Rama's arrows, the ground was littered with (bodies of) demons with limbs dismembered, headdresses and shoulders cut off, arms, thighs and knees decked with various ornaments amputated, chariots, horses, best of elephants, fans made of the tail of chamari deer (used as an insignia of royalty), umbrellas, several  flags, and weapons like spears, swords, darts, battleaxes and stones crushed into pieces and arrows splintered and scattered all over. The ground looked frightening.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Mightyarmed Dusana saw  the army  getting killed in war. He led the forces of five thousand demons, dreadfuly quick at fighting, dangeous to face and who will not beat a retreat.
The demons continuously hurled at him (Rama)  spears and swords and rained stones, trees and arrows from all sides
Righteous Rama, retaliated with his sharp arrows such as the rain of trees and stones, the mighty destroyers of life.
Rama retaliated in great anger to kill without caring for the shower of weapons like a bull with its eyes closed.
Overpowered by anger, Rama, with a blazing glow, covered Dusana and his army with his arrows.
Thereafter Dusana, chief of the army, angrily released at Rama equally powerful arrows comparable to thunderbolt.
Heroic Rama, mighty angry, then, broke the big bow of  Dusana, with his swordlike arrow. And with a series of four arrows cut his four horses to pieces.
After killing the horses with sharp arrows Rama severed the charioteer's head with an arrow of the shape of the crescent moon and pierced Dusana's chest with a set of three arrows.
With his bow and chariot broken, charioteer and horses killed,  Dusana took up a spear in his hand that appeared like a huge mountain top. Bound by golden bands, covered the iron nails, wetted with the enemy's marrow it created a horripilation. It appeared as though it  could crush the army of gods and render the enemy powerless. It carried the killing touch of the thunderbolt and could break open the enemy's fort.
With the spear that looked like a mighty serpent, Dusana, the cruel demon, advanced towards Rama.
Seeing Dusana going to pounce upon him, Rama cut off with two arrows both his arms adorned with armlets.
With the hands amputated, his huge spear, like the banner of Indra, slipped off his hands and fell down on the ground on the battle front.
Dusana fell down on the ground with broken hands like a proud elephant with both his tusks shattered.
Seeing Dusaana collapse dead on the ground, all beings hailed Rama, saying, 'Well done, well done'.
Meanwhile all the three army chiefs, Mahakapala, Sthulaksha, and the mighty Pramathi ran towards Rama in anger, bound (as though) by the noose of death.
Mahakapala had a huge spear, Sthulaksha, a sharpedged spear and Pramathi, a battleaxe.
On seeing them rushing to attack him with sharp weapons, Rama received them quickly with pointed arrows as though they were guests.
Mahakapala's head was cut to pieces with sharp arrows and Pramathi was killed with a countless series  of arrows. Pramathi's body, like a huge tree with many branches collapsed on the ground.
Rama filled the eyes of Sthulaksha with sharp arrows, and in anger shot five thousand arrows at the five thousand followers of Dusana in a moment and sent them to the abode of Yama.
Seeing Dusana and his followers killed, enraged Khara commanded his extremely strong army chiefs this way:
Dusana and his followers are killed in the battle. You, all the demons, along with your great army and different kinds of weapons should kill that wicked human being, Rama.
Having spoken thus, angry Khara ran towards Rama. Syenagami, Pruthugriva, Yajnasatru, Vihanga, Durjaya, Karaveeraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghamali, Mahamali, Sarpasya, Rudhirasanaall these twelve valiant army chiefs along with their forces rushed towards Rama, releasing the sharpest arrows at him.
Powerful Rama thereafter slayed the remaining army with his weapons studded with gold and diamonds and glowing like fire.
The goldtipped arrows which resembled fire covered with smoke shattered the army of demons like huge trees knocked down by thunder.
Rama killed a hundred demons  with one hundred arrows by a single stroke. The same way he killed a thousand of them with a thousand arrows on the battle front.
The demons fell down on the ground with their shields  and ornaments broken, their  bows stained with blood splintered.
The entire ground was littered with bodies of demons fallen in the battle with loose hair and with drops of blood on them looking like a great sacrificial altar strewn all over with kusa grass.
With the slaughtered bodies of demons lying on the ground, the forest in a moment looked very dreadful like hell with the mud of soil soaked with flesh and blood.
Fourteen thousand formidable demons were killed by Rama, a pedestrian human,  singlehanded.
Of that entire army great warrior Khara,Trisira and Rama, destroyer of foes alone remained.
The rest of the mighty, dreadful, intolerable demons were killed on the war front by Rama, elder brother to Lakshmana.
Thereafter seeing the formidable army killed by mighty Rama, Khara lifted a thunderbolt like Indra, and advanced towards Rama in a great chariot.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वालमिकिय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षङ्विंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentysixth sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
As Khara advanced towards Rama, Trisira the chief of the army approached him and said these words:
O valiant one assign this work to me. Refrain from this audacity. See how I am going to put down the mightyarmed Rama in the battle.
I promise you on my weapon that I will kill Rama.He who killed all demons deserves to be slain.
Restrain yourself for a moment from the enthusiasm to fight the war. Please act as an arbitrator and see who is killing whom.
If Rama is killed be happy and go to Janasthana or else if I am killed you can fight.
When Khara was prevailed upon by Trisara in that manner with a wish to face death, Khara  permitted him  by saying 'You may go and fight'.Accordingly he advanced towards Rama.
Trisira who looked a mountain with three peaks also got horses harnessed to a shining chariot and to attack Rama proceeded.
Trisira unleashed a stream of arrows like a huge cloud (releasing rain). They produced sound, a drum drenched with water, creates.
On seeing demon Trisira advancing towards him, Rama shook sharp arrows off his bow.
The tumultuous combat between Rama and Trisira looked like the strong fight between a lion and an elephant.
Then Rama hit  with three arrows on the forehead by Trisira flew into a fury and said in a state of great excitement:
Oh see the strength of this undaunted demon whose arrows fell like flowers on my forehead and only left a scratch.
Receive the arrows released from my bowstring. Saying so, the angry and agitated Rama discharged fourteen arrows, venomous like a snake, on the chest of Trisira .
With four arrows having strong joints, the mighty hero (Rama) threw down his enemy's four swiftfooted horses.
Rama brought down the charioteer with eight arrows and with one tore down the lofty banner of the chariot to shreds.
Rama then hit the demon with arrows on his chest while he was running away from the broken chariot. The demon became numb.
The mighty Rama in fury dismembered the heads of that demon with three sharp and swift arrows.
The demon with his heads decapitated, hit by Rama's arrows a little while ago, fell down, vomitting blood.
Those surviving demons who were under the protection of Khara got scared and retreated fast and fled like deer frightened by a tiger.
Personally persuading the fleeing army to come back, the angry Khara leaped forward towards Rama just as Rahu approaches the moon.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Khara was overtaken by fear at the prowess of Rama, when he saw Dusana and Trisira killed.
Khara, the mighty demon, saw his large, irrepressible army killed. He saw Trisira and Dusana slain singlehanded by Rama. Nervous, he advanced towards Rama wage war just as Namuchi approached Indra.
Khara drew his strong bowstring in anger and released the bloodhungry arrows, which appeared like venomous snakes.
Khara, sat on the chariot, and with a twang of his bowstring released arrows in all directions, exhibiting his skill in the use of weapons.
When Rama, the great warrior, saw Khara approaching him, he fixed powerful arrows  on his bow and covered all directions and intermediate quarters with his arrows.
He rained sparkling arrows which were irresistible. He filled the sky with arrows just as the raingod fills it with rain without leaving any space.
The arrows released by Khara and Rama on one another filled the entire sky. Everywhere only arrows and no sky could be seen.
While they were engaged in the battle, eager to kill each other the sky was covered with arrow and the Sun could not be seen.
Then Khara shot Rama with Nalika darts and darts called Vikarni like goads hit a mighty elephant.
Demon Khara positioned on the chariot, bow in hand, appeared to all beings like Yama, god of death holding the noose.
Khara thought valiant Rama who had destroyed his whole army might be exhausted by now.
When Rama saw Khara aggressively advancing like a lion to attack him, he was not perturbed, for he knew he was a fawn before a lion (which Rama was).
Then Khara mounting a great chariot which was glowing like the Sun, advanced towards Rama just as an insect hurtles towards fire.
Exhibiting his agility of the hand, Khara shattered the bow and the arrow in the grip of Rama ,the  great soul.
The influriated Khara this time took up seven arrows blazing like Indra's thunderbolt  and hit his armour.
The armour of Rama who looked radiant like the Sun fell on the ground, struck by the welljointed darts released by Khara.
Khara then attacked Rama of unequal strength in fight, with a thousand darts  and roared loudly.
Rama, scion of the Raghu race, afflicted by the darts in all parts of the body, glowed in his anger like smokeless fire burning.
Then Rama, destroyer of foes, strung another great bow of fearful sound in order to put an end to the enemy.
Thereafter Rama advanced, aiming at Khara the superior Vaishnava bow given by sage Agastya.
Rama took up in a rage the welljointed, smooth darts with golden feathers and broke the flag post of the chariot of Khara to pieces.
The beautiful, golden flag post, broken into several pieces, fell down on earth.It appeared as if the Sun had come down to earth at the behest of the gods.
Quite enraged, Khara who knew how to hit the tender parts (of the body) in an encounter sent out four arrows on Rama. It was like poking an elephant's limbs with a javelin.
Rama, hit by the arrows released from the bow of Khara, all his limbs drenched in blood, became very furious.
The best among archers and a supreme shooter, he lifted the bow, fixed his target and released six arrows in the great fight.
Rama hit one arrow on the head, two on the shoulders and three of the shape of the crescent moon on the chest (of the enemy).
Enraged and effulgent Rama took up thirteen darts, radiant like the Sun, with a wish to kill the demon.
Rama, like Indra, strong and mighty, broke the yoke of Khara's chariot with one arrow, the four horses with four arrows, and with the sixth the charioteer's head, with three others the main pole of the chariot, with two the axle of the chariot, and with the twelfth Khara's bow and arrows were splintered. As if laughing at him, he pierced Khara's body with the thirteenth arrow.
Then, with bow broken, chariot destroyed, horses and charioteer dead, Khara jumped  down the chariot and stood on the ground holding a mace.
Then the gods, along with great sages came down in aerial chariots and assembled there. Delighted, they adored Rama, the great warrior, with folded hands for the work done.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकिय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टाविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyeigth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Effulgent Rama looked at Khara who stood with a mace in hand minus his chariot  and said to him first in a gentle voice and then harshly :
Although you command a huge army with many elephants, horses, chariots, etc.  you have done such cruel deeds that the entire world despises you.
One who  is wicked, does sinful deeds and causes distress to all beings, will not survive even if he is the lord of the three worlds.
O nightranger, one who does a horrific deed which is against the world will be killed like an evil serpent come near.
Whoever commits sinful deeds out of greed or passion and without realisation will be ruined at the end like a lizard that eats hailstone (and dies).
O demon  what benefit will you  get by killing the venerable ascetics, followers of righteous path residing in Dandaka forest?
Cruel people, who are despised by the world for their sinful deeds, will not  be prosperous for long just like trees with decayed roots.
Just as the trees bear flowers at the proper season, so also people will certainly reap the fruits of their terrible, sinful deeds at appropriate time.
O nightranger  people will reap the result of their sinful actions in this world soon like one eating poisonous food.
O nightranger  I have come with the orders of the king to put an end to the lives of the perpetrators of dreadful, sinful and offensive deeds in this world.
Now when I unleash the golden  arrows, they will pierce through your body and come out like serpents emerging from the anthill.
Slain by me in the battle today, you and your army will follow the righteous men eaten by you in Dandaka forest.
The great seers whom you have earlier tortured and killed will, from their aerial vehicles, see you fallen into hell.
O vile fellow, now you may strike at me as you please. I will make your head fall  down like a palm fruit.
Challenged by Rama  in that manner, Khara, his senses switched off, eyes turned red due to anger, replied laughing :
O son of Dasaratha, it is not praiseworthy to kill ordinary demons in war. Why do you praise yourself for it?
The valiant, strong and the best of men do not at all speak proudly of themselves  and their valour.
O Rama common people, having no control over themselves and the lowest of kshatriyas boast of themselves in the world in a meaningless way as you are doing (now).
When death comes in a battle no hero will name his race and boast of himself unnessarily.
All your meanness is exhibited by your boasting just as the kusa grass caught by fire appears like gold.
Indeed, (it is strange that) you do not see me holding a mace and standing here like an unshakeable mountain which contains minerals and supports the earth.
Just like lord Yama, holding a noose of death is alone enough to destroy the three worlds, I am alone sufficient to take away your life in war, a mace in hand.
Indeed, I shall not speak any more even though a lot can be said on you. But the Sun is about to set and it will be improper to wage war thereafter.
You have killed these fourteen thousand demons. Therefore, I will wipe their tears by destroying you.
Having said this, highly enraged Khara adorned with large shoulder bands, hurled  at Rama, his mace glowing like a thunderbolt.
The huge, blazing mace hurled by Khara's arms reduced the trees and shrubs into ashes and came close to Rama.
The mace, which moved in the sky burning like the noose of death was shattered to pieces by Rama.
The mace shattered by the arrows of Rama , fell down scattered to pieces on the ground like a female serpent subdued by the force of mantras and medicine.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, fond of dharma, broke into pieces Khara's mace with his arrows, and smiling at bewildered Khara, said:
O lowly demon, you have already exhibited all your strength. Inferior to me in energy, you are needlessly roaring.
The mace about which you boasted so much has betrayed your confidence. Shattered by my arrows it now lies on the ground.
You said you will wipe the tears of the dead demons. (Now) those words have proved false.
You are mean. You have false pride. You are of low behaviour. I shall take away your life, O demon,, Just as Garuda carried off the nectar.
Now with your throat split open by my arrows , the earth will drink your foamy blood full of bubbles.
With all your limbs covered with dust, both the arms dropped down and stretched  out  on the ground, you will sleep as though hugging the earth, like embracing a rare woman.
When you, O vile demon, will go into eternal sleep the Dandaka grounds will provide shelter to those who deserve it here.
O demon, when my arrows destroy your hold over Janasthana the sages will move freely without fear all over this forest.
Having lost all their relations, the demonesses, who were causing fear to others,will move away with faces full of tears.
Your wives, who have got a husband like you, must have been born to a befitting race. They will taste the pangs of sorrow today, for no reasons whatsoever.
O cruel, mean, vile fellow, you had been always opposing the brahmins who pour oblations in fire under fear.
When Rama was thus speaking in a state of excitement in the middle of war, the choleric Khara  started abusing him in a harsher tone.
You are very haughty. When there is every cause of fear you pretend fearlessness. Being in the grip of death you do not know what to speak and what not to speak.
Those bound by the noose of death, do not know what to and what not to do, as their six senses cease to function.
Having said thus to Rama with a frown on his face, Khara, looking around for something to strike him with, saw a huge sal tree not very far.
Khara, biting his lower lip, uprooted the tree , lifted it with his mighty arms, and shouting at Rama loudly hurled it at him, saying, 'You are dead'.
Brave Rama shattered with a flood of arrows the tree falling over him and summoned sharp anger to end Khara in war.
Full of sweat and with the corners of his eyes turned red, Rama hit Khara with a thousand arrows in the encounter.
With his body pierced with arrows his blood started flowing like the waterfalls flow from mount Prasravana.
Completely struck by Rama's arrows, Khara, intoxicated with the smell of  blood, ran speedily charging towards Rama.
Rama who was an adept in the science of arms picked up his valour quickly and moved a step back (not  to give him an opportunity to strike), looking at the highly agitated Khara falling upon him, with his body fully drenched in blood.
Rama took a dart glowing like fire which resembled another Brahmadanda to kill Khara in the war.
Righteous Rama placed on his bow the dart given him by wise Indra, king of the gods, and shot it at Khara.
Bending the bow fully, Rama released the arrow roaring like a violent gust of wind, which fell on Khara's chest.
Just as Yama was burnt by Rudra's fire(from his eyes) in Swetaranya, Khara collapsed on the ground consumed by the fire of Rama's arrow.
Khara fell down just like Vrutra or Bala killed by Indra's thunderbolt or like Numuchi by the froth of the sea.
Then the rajarsis, great seers gathered together, offered their worship to Rama  and said these words joyfully :
For this purpose, killer of Paka, the gIorious Indra (who can break a fortress), came to the hermitage of Sarabhanga.
You are brought to this place by the great sages who had cleverly devised a plan to kill the cruel sinners, these demons৷৷
O son of Dasaratha, you have accomplished such a task that hereafter the sages in Dandaka will discharge their rightful duties happily.
Meanwhile the wonderstruck gods along with the charanas (celestial bards) got together and began beating the drums and raining showers of flowers on Rama from all sides.
'In a little more than half a moment of this great war Rama had accomplished the terrific task of killing with sharp darts fourteen thousand demons, led by Khara and Dusana.
'Rama who knows the self has performed a great work. Oh what prowess what efficiency  only lord Visnu could do this'. So saying all the gods went back to their respective destinations.
In the mean time, heroic Lakshmana accompanied by Sita came out of the mountain cave happily and entered the hermitage.
Then victorious Rama having been worshipped by the seers and also by Lakshmana entered the hermitage.
On seeing Rama killing the enemies of the great sages for their happiness Sita felt glad and embraced her husband.
Sita, daughter of Janaka, was happy to see the demons killed by Rama who himself was unhurt.
Then the daughter of Janaka, cheerful Sita, who had a face bright like the moon, embraced Rama, destroyer of demons who was worshipped by the delighted sages. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Quickly did Akampana leave Janasthana, and quickly he entered Lanka. He said to Ravana:
O king many demons dwelling at Janasthana including Khara have been killed. I manged to escape with much difficulty.
When Akampana thus reported to the tenheaded Ravana, his eyes reddened with anger. He spoke to Akampana as if he was burning him with his eyes :
He who has destroyed my beautiful Janasthana is sure to die. His life is under the control of others (his enemies). Where can he be(alive) in all the worlds?
One who has caused displeasure to me cannot be happy, be it Indra or Kubera, or Yama or even Visnu.
I am the destroyer of the destroyer (Yama). I can burn even that which burns (fire). I can infuse Death with the characteristics of death itself.
If angry, I can burn the Sun and even fire with my radiance. I can arrest  the speed of the wind instantly with my effort.
Akampana, out of fear, implored the inflamed Ravana with folded hands and faltering voice to spare him.
The tenheaded Ravana, lord of the demons, assured safety to Akampana, who  gratefully said these words without hesitation:
Dasaratha has  a young son,  by name, Rama. He has a body like a lion's. He has strong, round arms and his shoulders resemble those of a bull.
He is a hero of great fame and unequal prowess. He has destroyed your Janasthana and also Khara along with Dusana.
Having heard Akampana's words, Ravana, the lord of demons, sighed heavily like the king of serpents and said these words:
Did Rama come to Janasthana with Indra and the gods ? O Akampana   speak.
Hearing Ravana's words, Akampana continued telling about great Rama's strength and his exploits in war.
Rama is his name. He looks very radiant. He is the best among the archers. Owner of divine weapons, he is comparable to Indra in war.
He is strong with bright red eyes. He has a deep voice with the resonance of a drum. His face is like the moon. Lakshmana, his younger brother, is similar to him in appearance.
Rama is prosperous. He is the best among kings. Lakshmana with him is like wind with fire. Rama has pulled down Janasthana.
Indeed, they are great men. No god came there (to lend him a hand). There is no need to investigate further about it.  The goldenfeathered arrows released by Rama turned into fivehooded serpents and consumed the demons.
Wherever the demons went they, gripped by fear, only saw Rama in front. O sinless sire In this manner your Janasthana was destroyed by him.
Hearing Akampana's words, Ravana said, I will go to Janasthana and kill Rama along with Lakshmana.
Thus said by Ravana, Akampana responded, I will tell you what happened there. O king   listen to the strength and valour of Rama.
Rama is of great fame. When outraged, he is irrepressible. He can arrest with his arrows even the speed of a river (in spate).
Powerful Rama can pull down the sky along with the planets and stars. He can lift the drowning earth from the depth of the sea.
He is so very powerful that he can drown the earth by breaking the boundary of the sea. He can arrest the speed of the sea or of the wind with his arrows.
He is a tiger among men. He is so powerful that he can destroy the world and recreate the creatures once again by his valour.
O tenheaded one, just as it is not possible for sinners to attain heaven it is not possible for you or for the entire world of demons to win him in war
I do not think it is possible for gods and demons together to kill him, yet there is a way for his destruction. You may listen to me with single mindedattention:
Rama has a wife in this world, by name, Sita, who is beautiful, has a slender waist and a wellformed body. Adorned with gems, she is a jewel among women,
She has no equal among goddesses nor among gandharvis nor apasaras nor among demonesses. How can there be a peer of her among human beings ?
Abduct Rama's wife by force in that great forest and bereft of Sita, he will give up his life.
Ravana, the strongarmed king of demons, relished the words of Akampana and pondering over the matter, said to him :
Yes, early in the morning I will go alone gladly with the charioteer and bring Vaidehi here to this great city.
Having said so, Ravana got on a chariot yoked with donkeys. It had the colour of the Sun. It illuminated all directions. Ravana left.
The great chariot of the demon king (Ravana) flying in the sky shone like the Moon in the cloud.
Ravana reached the hermitage of Maricha and met him who was the son of Tataka. The demon king was treated with food that can be chewed and food that can be eaten.
Maricha personally offered Ravana a seat. He offered him water and paid him obeisance. Making meaningful enquiries he said in appropriate words :
O lord of demons  O king hope every one is fine in the world of demons. O lord, (though) your sudden arrival puts me in doubt (about everything going right).
Having thus been asked by Maricha, glorious Ravana, who was eloquent in speech, spoke to him :
O dear, Rama who is capable of doing difficult deeds has killed my sentinels. The indestructible Janasthana has been routed in war. Could you help me in abudcting his wife ? (That is the only way to bring him to his knees).
Having heard Ravana ,the king of demons, Maricha said these words:  O king, who is that enemy of yours who, in the guise of a friend,  has told you about Sita? Though obliged by you, who is he that is not happy with you, O tiger among demons?
Tell me who asked you to bring Sita ? Who wishes to demolish the peak of the entire clan of demons ?
He who has encouraged you in this is your enemy, indeed. He wants you to pluck out the fangs from the serpent's mouth.
By  whose action have you been led into this wrong direction? Who has hit you on your forehead while you were sleeping comfortably?
