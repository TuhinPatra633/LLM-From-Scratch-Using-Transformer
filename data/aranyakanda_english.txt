The invincible and selfpossessed Rama entered the great forest of Dandaka and saw there a multitude of hermitages of the ascetics.
They (the hermitages) were strewn all over with kusa grass and robes by bark with auspicious sacrificial materials around and hence dazzling like the orb of the sun in the sky difficult to gaze.
The courtyards (of the hermitages) were cleanswept, sprinkled with water and decorated. They provided shelter to all kinds of creatures and were filled all over with  flocks of birds and antelopes.
The hermitages looked glorified with dances by celestial damsels. They were  adorned with vast fire sanctuaries, ladles for sacrificial ceremonies, deerskins and kusa grass faggots for pots of water, roots and fruits. They looked delightful with huge sacred trees of the forest laden with sweet fruits.
The hermitages where various sacrificial offerings were made reverberated with Vedic chantings. Flowers were scattered all over. There was a lotuspond with lotuses. There were aged, selfrestrained sages glowing like the Sun or the fire, living on fruits and roots, clothed in bark and dark  deerskin.
The hermitages echoing with  the sounds of Vedic recitations and resembling the very abode of Brahma were adorned with great, holy sages living on regulated diet.
The illustrious, effulgent Rama saw groups of hermitages adorned with venerable brahmins, with knowledge of the Supreme Spirit. On seeing them he loosened the string of his great bow and went forward.
On seeing Rama with illustrious Sita, the great sages, richly endowed with divine knowledge, went forward to greet him.
The sages, steadfast in their vows, saw Rama who was shining like the rising Moon, Lakshmana and the famed Sita went forward and received them with words of benediction.
Those sages living  in the forest were wonderstruck to see the handsome, graceful, delicate and welldressed Rama.
All the foresters looked at the wonderful figures of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana with unblinking eyes.
Ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, the sages made Rama, their guest, sit in their leafy hut.
The great sages comparable to the firegod and followers of righteousness honoured Rama  according to tradition by offering water.
The sages who were knowers of dharma saluted the noble Rama, offered fruits, roots and flowers available  at the hermitage and with folded palms said thus:
O king of great reputation, you are the refuge of the people, a protector of dharma, a chastiser of wrongdoers, a worshipful and respectable preceptor.
O Rama, in this world a king is considered the fourth part of Indra as he protects the people. Therefore, he is respected and he enjoys the choicest pleasures of life.
Since we are the residents of your territory we deserve to be protected by you. Whether you live in the city or in the forest, you are the lord of the people and our king.
O king, we have conquered our anger and have controlled our senses. We ascetics have cast aside all our authority. We are like your children and need to be protected by you forever
Having said so, the ascetics offered with reverence fruits, roots, flowers and other forest  products to Rama and Lakshmana.
After receiving hospitality from the sages, Rama took of all of them at sunrise and entered deep into the forest.
With Lakshmana following, Rama went through the forest, filled with herds of animals and inhabited by bears and tigers. It was a place where trees, creepers and bushes were crushed (by frequent visits of demons). It was difficult to locate a water source.  And it resounded with the chirping of various birds and insects (crickets).
While Rama along with Sita was wandering in the forest infested with  dreadful animals, he saw a roaring cannibal resembling the peak of a mountain.
He was of dreadful appearance with deep eyes, a huge face and a big belly. He looked tall, ugly and frightening.
Wearing a tigerskin, he resembled the god of death. With a wide, open mouth, wet with marrow and drenched with blood, he struck terror into  all beings.
Roaring loudly, he carried an iron spit in which were pierced three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten deer  and the huge head of an elephant with its tusks smeared with the fat of flesh.
Looking extremely furious, he ran towards Rama, Lakshmana and Sita like the god of death rushes towards the (dying) people.
Making a dreadful sound, as if shaking the earth, he took Sita on his lap, stepped aside and said:
You both clad in bark and wearing matted hair, holding bows, arrows and swords have entered into the Dandaka forest with your wife. Your life has been cut short indeed৷৷
How is it that you both, dressed in the robes of ascetics, live  with a woman? Leading an unrighteous and sinful life, who are you who have brought disgrace to the ascetic discipline ?
I am a demon named Viradha. I move in this dense forest with my weapons eating the flesh of the sages.
This  woman of fine hips shall be my wife. You sinners I shall drink  the blood of both of you in the fight.
Sita, daughter of Janaka was bewildered out of fear when she heard the cruel  and boastful words of that wicked Viradha.
Seeing the auspicious Sita in the lap of Viradha shaken out of anxiety, like a plantain tree in a strong wind, Rama with his throat parched said to Lakshmana:
Gentle Lakshmana, see the illustrious daughter ofJanaka, a lady of good conduct,  brought up in utmost comfort caught in the lap of Viradha
O Lakshmana whatever Kaikeyi desired through her boons has now come true so soon.
Kaikeyi, my middle mother is farsighted indeed  Not content with the kingdom alone see sent me, beloved of all  beings, away to the forest. Let her cherished desire be fulfilled.
O Lakshmana nothing is more sorrowful to me than the touch of Vaidehi by another. It is more painful to me than the death of my father or loss of my kingdom.
As Rama was thus full of tears of sorrow, Lakshmana sighed heavily in anger like a hissing serpant in confinement. And said:
O Rama, you are, like Indra, lord of all beings. What makes you feel sad like an orphan when I am at your service like a servant?
The earth will drink the blood of Viradha with his life gone, slain by my angry arrow.
Like Indra who hits the mountain with his thunderbolt, I shall release on Viradha the anger I felt against Bharata for his passion for the kingdom.
Spurred by the speed of my strong arms, my arrow will fall on his broad chest and separate his life from his body. Then his body reeling round and round will fall on the ground.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वितीयस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the second sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Graceful Lakshmana asked  Viradha  with a smile, Who are you wandering in the forest at will ?.
Then Viradha with his voice filling the forest said, Instead of asking about me you both should speak out who  you are and where you are going
Questioned by the demon, who bore a burning countenance, the highly effulgent Rama introduced his Ikshvaku family:
Know us to be both kshatriyas, endowed with a good lineage and yet moving in the forest. We both wish to know, who you are and why you are going about in Dandaka forest?
Then Viradha said to Rama whose truth was his strength, I will tell you who I am. O, listen:
I am indeed son to Jaya. My mother is Satahrada. Verily all the demons on this earth call me Viradha.
By the grace of Lord Brahma I was bestowed with this prowess through my penance. In this world none can kill me with a weapon nor split nor cut me to pieces.
Therefore, leave this lady and run away to the place you came from. I will not take away your life .
With eyes reddened with anger Rama replied to the sinful, deformed Viradha:
O vile, mean creature  surely you are seeking death. Wait, you will meet it in the fight.
Then Rama strung his bow immediately, shot the sharp arrows at Viradha and hit him verily.
From his bow  strung tight,  Rama shot seven swift, goldenfeathered arrows comparable to Garuda  and the Windgod in speed.
The arrows tied with peacockfeathers, looking like fire, pierced the body of Viradha which, drenched in blood, fell on the ground.
Hit  by Rama and Lakshmana, the enraged  demon left Vaidehi, lifted a sharp spear   and ran towards them.
The demon who produced a great noise with his wide open mouth resembled the god of death. He lifted a sharp spike that looked like Indra's banner.
And then both the brothers showered bright arrows on the demon Viradha who looked like Yama, the god of death.
The demon who was extremely frightening stood there, laughing and yawning.  As he yawned, all the swiftlyflying arrows fell out of his body.
By virtue of a boon Viradha, the demon, controlled the vital breath of his body by a mere touch and, raising the spike, ran towards the two Raghava princes.
With two arrows, Rama, the best among wielders of weapons, broke down the spike in the sky burning like fire, and resembling the  thunderbolt of Indra.
The spike, broken down by Rama's arrow, fell like a slab of mount Meru splintered by Indra's thunder.
Then both Rama and Lakshmana quickly raised their swords which looked like black serpents and at once fell upon the demon who was going to strike with great force.
Struck down, the angry demon tightly caught hold of both of them under his arms and wanted to set out, carrying Rama and Lakshmana, the two unshakeable tigers among men.
Rama understood the intention of the demon and said to Lakshmana, Let him go his way, no need to stop him.
O Lakshmana, let the nightstalker go the way he wishes. That is, in fact, our path.
Puffed up with his own great strength, Viradha lifted them and placed them on his shoulders as though they were two children.
Then the nightstalker proceeded towards the forest, carrying both the scions of the Raghu race on his shouldersroaring.
Seeing those two mightyarmed Rama and Lakshmana being carried away by Viradha, Sita started crying loudly:
The wild bears, tigers and panthers will eat me up here. O best among demons, pray take me and leave both the Kakutsthas.
On hearing those words of  Sita, both the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana hastened to kill the wicked Viradha.
Lakshmana quickly broke the left and Rama the right shoulder of that dreadful demon.
With both shoulders broken, the demon, looking like a cloud (huge and dark) fell at once on the ground like a mountain split by a thunderbolt.
Striking the demon with fists, knees and feet, both of them smit him  on the bare ground and pulverized him.
Although pierced by arrows, and wounded by the two swords, and pulverized on the ground, the demon did not die.
Seeing the mountainlike Viradha not dying though seriously wounded, illustrious Rama, guaranter of safety from fear said to Lakshmana:
O Lakshmana, best among men, this demon by virtue of his penance cannot be killed with any weapon in war. Therefore, let us bury him.
Dig a deep pit to bury this demon, dreadful like an elephant and emitting a fearful glow.
Courageous Rama standing there put his foot firmly on the neck of Viradha and said to Lakshmana,' Dig up a crevice'.
When the demon Viradha heard Rama saying so, he said these humble words to the scion of the Kakutsthas and the best of men :
You have killed me, O Rama, a tiger among men. You are equal to Indra in prowess. O best of men, out of delusion I could not recognise you earlier.
O dear Rama, I know now you are the blessed son of Kausalya, Sita is a noble lady and a glorious soul.
I am Tumburu by name,  a celestial singer of the gandharva clan. Cursed by Kubera, I got this dreadful body of a demon.
When I appealed to him, that lord of great fame (Kubera) said that I would get back my original form and ascend to heaven when Rama, son of Dasaratha, would kill me in a duel.
When king Kubera saw me absent (from duty) as I was infatuated with Rambha, he got angry and cursed me.
O scorcher of enemies by your grace I am rid of the curse. Delivered from my dreadful form, I will now go to my world. May both of you fare well.
O dear, there lives Sarabhanga, a righteous sage, comparable to the Sun, at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here. Go to him at once. He will bless you with your wellbeing.
Bury me in the pit, O Rama, and proceed happily. This is a great tradition for the dead demons. Those who are buried in the pit attain heaven.
Having said so to Rama, the mighty  Viradha, hit by the arrows left his body and attained heaven.
When Rama heard those words, he said, O Lakshmana dig for this elephantlike demon of dreadful acts, a big pit. Having said so the mighty Rama stood firmly stamping the neck of Viradha with his foot.
Then Lakshmana fetched a spade and dug a sufficiently big pit by the side of the great soul Viradha.
Rama took his foot off Viradha's neck and dropped his body with pointed ears into the pit while Viradha was groaning fearfully৷৷
Rama and Lakshmana, stable and firm, brave and quick, together lifted the body of Viradha who was fierce in battle and roaring and forcibly threw it into the pit with joy.
The two princes, bulls among men, who were adept in archery saw that the great demon could not be killed by any other means. They reflected over the issue  and undertook the task of killing him with sharp weapons and buried him in a pit.
Rama deliberately wanted to kill Viradha with weapons. Viradha the forestranger himself revealed that it was not possible to kill him with weapons and asked Rama to bury him in a pit.
While Rama, who had made up his mind after hearing him, was putting the mighty demon in the pit, the forest rang with his roar.
Rama and Lakshmana were happy to consign Viradha's body to the pit after killing him. They filled the pit with rocks in the great forest without fear.
On killing Viradha, the demon of terrific strength, heroic Rama embraced Sita, consoled her and said to his brother Lakshmana, glowing like fire:
This wild forest with which we have not been acquainted earlier is difficult  to pass. (Hence) let us proceed quickly to sage Sarabhanga.
Rama went to the hermitage of Sarabhanga, a sage with divine grace who had realised the supreme (by his penance). Thus by the side of the sage he witnessed a huge wonder.
Rama saw the lord of the gods (Indra) in the sky getting off the chariot, with his body shining brightly like the sun or the fire, followed by the gods, his feet untouched by the earth. Clad in spotless attire and adorned with shining ornaments, he was being worshipped by many greatsouls like him.
Not far from that place, Rama saw a chariot, yoked with tawnycoloured horses, shining like the morning  Sun. It looked like a palewhite cloud, resembling the lunar orb.
Rama saw a pure white umbrella with a highly expensive golden staff, decorated with variegated flower garlands.While near his (Indra's) head stood a pair of exquisite ladies with fans made of yak's tail.
Many celestial singers of heaven, gods, great sages and siddhas sang with the choicest words the glory of this god stationed in the sky.
While Indra was conversing with Sarabhanga, Rama saw him and said to Lakshmana.
Pointing at the chariot, Rama said, Lakshmana, see this wonderful, effulgent chariot endowed with grace is shining like the Sun in the sky.
The horses of Indra, who is often invoked (during sacrificial rituals) and about whom  we have heard earlier, are now stationed in the sky.
O Lakshmana  around the chariot stand hundreds of finest young men of about twentyfive years. Clad in red robes, they are wearing earrings, and holding swords in their hands. They have broad chests and stout arms like iron beams. Like tigers, they are difficult to overpower. They have necklaces hanging on their chests blazing like fire.
These tigers among men have cheerful countenacess from which it can be deduced that the age of the gods always remains constant.
Lakshmana, stay here with Sita awhile, until I ascertain who this dazzling being on the chariot is.
Instructing Lakshmana to wait , Rama  went towards Sarabhanga's hermitage.
Then Indra (husband of Sachi) having seen Rama coming towards him, approached Sarabhanga and said this to him privately:
Here comes Rama. Before he talks to me, take me to some other place from where he may not be able to see me. He has to do a great task which is difficult for others. I can see him when he accomplishes the taste and emerges victorious.
This way honouring the sage Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, took leave of him and went to heaven in his chariot harressed with horses.
When Indra departed like that, Rama with his retinue (Sita and Lakshmana) went to Sarabhanga who was sitting by the side of the firealtar (for Agnihotra).
Rama, Sita and Lakshmana prostrated at Sarabhanga's feet. After being permitted to sit, they were invited to stay there.
Thereafter on Rama's query Sarabhanga told him all about Indra's visit:
O Rama, Indra, the bestower of boons, wants to take me to the world of Brahma,  earned by me through severe penance which is most difficult to be attained by those devoid of selfrealisation.
O Rama, the best among men you are a very dear guest to me and knowing that you are near, I will not go to the world of Brahman without seeing you.
O Rama, the best of men  (only) after seeing a great, virtuous soul like you shall I go to heaven, the abode of the gods.
O tiger among men, I have conquered heavenly abodes as well as the imperishable, auspicious worlds of Brahma. Accept them all that are mine (obtained through my penance)
To these words of sage Sarabhanga Rama, the best of men, the knower of all sastras, the scion of the Raghus replied:
O great sage, I will earn all the worlds myself if you direct me. But I need a proper dwellingplace in this forest.
To this request of Rama who was equal to Indra in strength, sagacious Sarabhanga said these words:
Here dwells in this forest a brilliant saint, righteous and selfcontrolled, Sutikshna by name who will look to your welfare, O Rama
You may approach sage, Sutikshna residing in a sacred spot. He will provide you a delightful place for your stay in the forest.
Proceed, O Rama  in the reverse direction of the river Mandakini carrying flowers and floats. And you will reach the place.
O Rama, the best among men, this is the way. Look at me for a while, my dear, until I shed my limbs just as a snake sheds its withered slough.
Then the effulgent Sarabhanga, knower of mantras (magical spells) kindled the fire with faggots and after offering oblations of ghee plunged in.
Then were consumed that highsouled Sarabhanga's hair on the body and on the head, the wornout skin, the bones and flesh along with blood.
Sarabhanga then emerged youthful from that heap of fire, shining like a flame and looking very elegant৷৷
Sarabhanga then went beyond the worlds of the gods, of the great sages who constantly kindle sacrificial fire, and ascended to the world of Brahman.
Sarabhanga, performer of sacred deeds, saw Brahma with his followers৷৷ Brahma also seeing Sarabhanga, the best among the brahmins,  welcomed him gladly.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चमः सर्गः।।Thus ends the fifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Sarabhanga attained the heaven, all the sages collected together and came to Rama whose radiance was like fire.
Vaikhanasas, Valakhilyas, sages who continuously wash their bodies, Marichakas Asmakuttas sages who live on leaves only, those who have teeth like mortar, Unmajjakas, those who use limbs as their bed, those who practise penance without using a bed, those who do penance in the open, unmindful of rain or Sun or wind, those who live on water only, those who penance under the open sky, those who carry on penance on high places like the mountaintop, those who recline on bare ground only, those who observe fast as a part of religious tradition, those selfrestrained men, those who mutter sacred mantras, those who constantly perform penance and those who stand under the blazing Sun in summer placing fire on four sides while performing penanceall these types of sages met Rama in the hermitage of Sarabhanga.
All groups of sages, who knew dharma, and were upholders of righteousness reached Rama, the supreme knower of dharma, and said:
O great charioteer you are the lord of the Ikshvaku race and of the world just like Indra, chief among the gods.
You are renowned in the three worlds for your valour, for your devotion to father, and in you lies enough evidence of your adherence to truth and righteousness.
O lord, do excuse us. We sought your help to fulfil our needs since you are at hand. You are a great soul, knower and lover of dharma.
O Lord, a king who collect one sixth of the produce as tax and yet does not protect his subjects like his children commits an act of grave injustice.
O Rama, whoever protects the inhabitants of his kingdom at all times like his own son who he loves more than his own life will attain the world of Brahma and remain there for long years and will achieve prosperity thereafter.
One fourth of the supreme merit a sage earns by living on fruits and roots, accrues to the king through which the people are protected righteously.
O Rama  we are a group of great sages, mostly brahmins, leading a vanaprastha  life. Yet with a protector like you, we are slaughtered in large numbers like orphans.
Come and see  the bodies of ascetics, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit, killed in large numbers in the forest by the fierce demons.
A great slaughter is taking place amongst those residing on the bank of the Pampa lake, near the river Mandakini, and on mount Chitrakuta.
We ascetics are not able to tolerate the fearful deeds perpetrated by the dreadful demons in the forest.
O Rama, you are worthy of refuge. Hence we have come to you seeking your protection. We are being killed by the nightstalkers. Save us.
O great warrior here on this earth there is no protector as mighty as you. So, O prince  save us all from these demons.
Having heard this, righteous Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty said to all the ascetics engaged in penance:
You should not speak to me this way. I deserve to be commanded by the ascetics. I have not entered this forest only on a personal mission.
I came into this forest in obedience to my father's orders to repel the aggression of demons against you.
I came here to acomplish your task incidentally, Therefore, my stay in the forest will yield great results.
I wish to kill in the fight the demons who are your enemies. O great ascetics, you may  witness my prowess supported by my brother.
Brave Rama, steadfast in righteousness, worthy of honour, gave assurance to protect the ascetics endowed with the wealth of penance, and proceeded towards sage Sutikshna.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षष्ठस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, the scorcher of enemies, along with his brother Lakshmana and Sita and the sages went to Sutikshna's hermitage.
After covering a long distance and crossing the river (Ganga) with plenty of water, Rama saw a huge mountain looking like a lofty cloud.
Rama and Lakshmana, the best of the Ikshvaku family, accompanied by Sita entered the dense forest  filled with trees all over.
Entering that dreadful forest, they saw trees full of flowers and fruits, and a hermitage in a lonely place with lines of bark robes hanging.
There at the hermitage was Sutikshna, an ascetic grown old with (long) penance, wearing soiled, matted locks and seated. Rama (first) addressed him as per custom.
O venerable one, I am Rama.You are a great sage, armed with truth as your prowess and a knower of dharma. I have come to see you. Could you speak to me?
Thereafter the composed Sutikshna, looked at Rama, the best among righteous men, and embracing him with both his arms said:
O Rama, the best among the Raghavas and among the upholders of truth, you are welcome. With your presence this hermitage will have a protector now.
O renowned hero, I had heard that you have come to Chitrakuta, renouncing your  kingdom. I have been waiting so long to see you here. Unable to give up this body, I did not even leave the earth for heaven, the world of the gods.
O scion of the Kakutstha family, Indra, king of the gods came to me and said that by my meritorious deeds I have won all the worlds.
Along with your wife and Lakshmana you may roam by my grace the worlds won by me and served by divine sages like devarsi Narada.
Selfpossessed Rama replied to the truthful ascetic who had performed intense penance. Just as Kasyapa would address Lord Brahma:
O great sage I will win all the worlds myself. I (only) want to live in this forest. Allow me.
You are ever engaged in the welfare of all beings. I have heard this from the great sage Sarabhanga of Gautama's clan.
Thus addressed by  Rama, Sutikshna, the great sage, wellknown to the world was highly delighted. He (then) said these sweet words:
O Rama this is a salubrious hermitage where hosts of sages live and which is full of roots and fruits, you may enjoy yourself here.
O illustrious Rama, herds of animals visit this place fearlessly, enticing the inmates and (then) go back without harming any one.
When heroic Rama heard that there was no other problem from the wild animals except their frequent incursions, he lifted his bow with an arrow and said these words:
O reverend one, I will kill with a sharpedged arrow, glowing like a thunderbolt, all those herds of animals who keep coming here.
What can be more agonizing for you (than my killing animals). I (therefore) do not foresee our long stay in this hermitage.
Rama stopped with this. And then the evening drew to a close. Offering his evening oblation, he arranged for his stay along with Sita and Lakshmana in the delightful hermitage of Sutikshna.
Seeing that the evening had passed and night had set in, the great sage Sutikshna with due hospitality, served those best of men, food fit for ascetics.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, worshipped by Sutikshna and accompanied by Lakshmana, spent the night at the hermitage, and got up early in the morning.
In the morning Rama and Sita got up in time and took bath in cool, lilyfragrant water.
And as per routine, sinless Sita, Rama and Lakshmana offered prayers to the fire and other gods of the forest which was the refuge of the ascetics. Seeing the rising Sun, they worshipped him, and approaching Sutikshna,  said these soothing words:
O revered Sutikshna received by one so worshipworthy like you, we spent the night well. We (now)take leave of you. The sages  are hastening us.
We wish to see the entire circle of hermitages of the sages, residing in Dandaka forest. So we are in a hurry.
We seek your permission to go with the great sages, who are ever engaged in righteousness, selfcontrolled by virtue of their penance, and are like flameless fire.
We wish to depart before the Sun grows unbearably hot like the man devoid of good lineage who acquires wealth through unlawful means (becomes arrogant). Thereafter Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana offered worship at the feet of the venerable sage.
When both Rama and Lakshmana touched the feet of Sutikshna, the best of the sages, he lifted them up, hugged them tightly, and said affectionately:
You may safely tread, O Rama, this path along with Lakshmana and Sita who is following you like a shadow.
O valient Rama the sages, living in  the Dandaka forest, are self realised souls. See how delightful is the location of their hermitages.
You will see the beautiful forestareas with abundant fruits and roots, flowers in full bloom, herds of animals, flocks of quiet birds tanks and lakes filled  with clean waters and shining with fully blossomed lotuses, resounding with waterducks and peacocks  and waterfalls coming down the hills. Thus you will enjoy a delightful sylvan sight.
O dear Rama, O Lakshmana you may leave (now), you may have to come back to this hermitage after seeing those places.
Thus addressed, Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas along with Lakshmana circumambulated the sage (in reverence) and set forth.
Thereafter largeeyed Sita handed the brothers two quivers, two bows as well as two excellent swords.
Both Rama and Lakshmana  tied their auspicious quivers, took the two twanging bows and departed from the hermitage.
Handsome Rama and Lakshmana, glowing in their radiance held the bows and exited  with Sita.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the eighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While Rama was leaving with the permission of Sutikshna, Sita spoke these warm, affectionate words to her husband:
This great path of dharma you are following now can be attained only through subtle means by one free from addiction born of passion.
There are three kinds of vices born out of lust. First, speaking untruth, second, having sexual relation with others' wives and third, resorting to violence with no enmity. The later two vices are of serious nature.
O Rama you never spoke untruth in the past nor will you speak in future. How can there be any desire in you to destroy the virtue of others' wives ?
O Rama, lord among men, you hadn't it (lust for other women) in the past. You havn't it now. Never does it exist even in your mind.
O prince, you are always faithful to your wife. You are righteous, truthful and obedient to your father's orders.
O Rama, you are truthful, honourable, powerful. O elder brother of Lakshmana, in you is established truth and righteousness.
O longarmed one, to contain all this is only possible for those who have conquered the senses. O handsome one, I know your ability to control the senses.
(But) you are a victim to the third (vice born of lust) i.e. showing violence without cause for enmity
O valiant one, you have promised to kill the demons in the battle, in order to protect the sages residing in the Dandaka forest.
It is only on account of this that you entered the wellknown Dandaka forest with your brother wielding bow and arrows.
I am, therefore, worried in my mind when I see you here and think of your wellbeing. I wish your ultimate good. [The next two lines appear, more or less, a repetition. So omitted : Editor]
O brave Rama, I do not like your going to Dandaka forest. I shall tell you the reason. Do listen.
Of course, you will go to the forest with your brother, holding the bow and arrows. Release the arrows when you see the forestrangers.
A bow in the hand of a kshatriya is like fuel to fire. It surely swells his strength and his brilliance.
O mightyarmed one, there dwelt in the past an ascetic, noble and truthful in a sacred forest where animals and birds lived merrily together.
Once Indra, husband of Sachi, came to his hermitage in the guise of an attendant, sword in hand, in order to hinder his penance.
Then while the sage was practising penance at the hermitage, he gave him that excellent sword to be kept in trust.
Having received the weapon as a trust, the sage went wandering in the forest, always attentive in safeguarding the weapon.
Vigilant about protecting the sword deposited with him, the sage never moved without it even when he went gathering roots and fruits.
While the sage moved about holding the weapon, he gave up the practice of penance gradually and developed a violent mindset.
By association with the sword, he developed a violent attitude. And in that habitual state of excitement he was dragged into unrighteous ways which (ultimately) took him to hell.
Contact with the weapon has led to this in the past. Like contact with fire, it leads man to destruction. I say this out of my love and reverence for you as a reminder and not as an instruction.
While holding a bow, you should not have the intention to kill demons residing in Dandaka with no animosity against you. O valiant one  I do not desire that any one should be killed without incurring any offence.
It is the duty of a kshatriya, a warrior to protect with his bow those who practise selfcontrol (penance) in the forest in a state of panic.
Where is the question of wielding a weapon and living in the forest, where is the life of a kshatriya and the life of penance? For us, this is an encroachment. Let the law of the land be honoured.
Lord, when we handle the weapon, the mind gets vitiated. (Only) after returning to Ayodhya can you perform the duty of a kshatriya.
You would have been on unlimited source of joy to my fatherinlaw and motherinlaw had you permanently renounced the kingdom for the life of an ascetic.
Righteousness brings wealth. Wealth brings happiness. Righteousness brings everything. In fact, the essence of the world is righteousness.
The wise earn dharma through getting their bodies emaciated by carefully adopting different means of discipline (selftorture). Happiness does not beget happiness.
O gentle one you may move in this forest of ascetics with a pure mind. The true meaning behind everything in these three worlds is known to you, indeed.
Having heard these words spoken by Sita who was devoted to her husband, replied Rama who was firm in righteousness.
O daughter of Janaka, you are conversant with dharma. Whatever you have admonished out of affection for me is befitting your race.
But permit me, Devi, you have already stated, when a kshatriya holds a bow there will be no cry of distress. (it means you approve of my holding a bow)
O Sita, the sages who perform rigorous penance in Dandaka forest came to me personally, seeking shelter although they can be their own protection.
The sages living in the forest, eating roots and fruits and ever engaged in righteous activities are afraid of the depredations of the demons, with their happiness gone.
The sages engrossed in various austerities in the forest have been victims to the dreadful demons living on human flesh.
The ascetics, the best of brahmins living in Dandaka forest being eaten up like that besought me to come to their rescue.
On hearing the words that came from their mouth, I bowed at their feet and said:
Be pleased  That brahmins like you have approached me while I should have come to you has put me to shame immeasurable .
I enquired about what I could do for them. And all the brahmins in one voice said:.
'O Rama, the demons who can assume any form at their will are mercilessly tormenting us in Dandaka forest. Do protect us from them'.
'O sinless one, these cannibals are invincible. They arrive at the time of our sacrificial rituals, on the days of festivities or at the time of lunar conjunctions like no moon or full moon days and attack us.
'You are the supreme refuge for us ascetics, tormented by demons, helpless men in search of shelter.
'O Rama it is difficult to perform penance which is ever full of obstacles. Therefore, we do not pronounce curses even if eaten up by demons'.
'The demons, dwelling in the Dandaka forest are tormenting us. You alone are our lord in the forest. Do protect us with your brother.'
O daughter of Janaka, on hearing the words of the sages I promised to undertake the entire protection of sages of the Dandaka forest.
Having promised the sages, I cannot do otherwise as long as I have life in me. To me truth is always dear.
O Sita I may forfeit my life forsake, even Lakshmana and you but will not break the promise made specially to the brahmins৷৷
Even before the sages requested me I should have protected them. What to speak of the promise I have already made ?
O sinless one all that has been said by you is out of your love and affection for me. I am pleased. What is harmful is never advised.
Your auspicious words are quite befitting your lineage. You are the follower of my dharma and so dearer to me than my life.
Having said this to Sita, the princess of Mithila, Rama along with Lakshmana, bow in hand, moved about the delightful penancegrove.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे दशमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the tenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by the sage Valmiki.
Rama walked in front, Sita with a beautiful waist, in the middle and Lakshmana holding the bow, behind them৷৷
Both Rama and Lakshmana walked on, accompanied by Sita, watching several beautiful mountain ranges, forests  and rivers.
(Watching) the swans and ruddy geese on river banks and lakes full of lotuses, and birds on water and in the sky.
(Watching) herds of deer, intoxicated horned buffaloes, wild boars and elephants who are enemies of trees (elephants uproof trees).
As the Sun was setting, they had covered a long distance, watching a yojanalong tank adorned with lotuses, and crowded with herds of elephants and flocks of cranes, swans and aquatic animals.
In that lake of clear waters they heard the sounds of songs and musical instruments, while there were none around.
Out of curiosity, mighty Rama, and Lakshmana started enquiring about the matter from sage Dharmabrata by name:
O great sage, this very wonderful sound, has whetted our great curiosity. If there is no top secret about this, do disclose it.
Thus addressed by Rama, the righteous sage narrated the entire origin of the lake.
O Rama this lake called Panchapsara  filled with water at all times has been created through penance by a sage called Mandakarni.
Great sage Mandakarni standing in water and living on air performed  rigorous penance for ten thousand years.
Thereafter very much perturbed, all the gods led by Agni gathered together at one place and started deliberating among themselves.
'The gods of heaven became agitated in their minds thinking the sage might usurp one of their places.
All the gods then engaged five of the important nymphs, glittering like lightning, to disturb the penance of the sage.
The sage, a knower of the inner self and the world of plurality, was gripped by passion for the apsaras, who had come to achieve the target of the gods.
The five apsaras, got the status of wives to the sage who built them an invisible home inside the lake.
The apsaras lived happily with the sage who remained youthful by virtue of his penance.
While the apsaras played their musical instruments, their melodious songs mingled with the sounds of ornaments are heard.
Glorious Rama and his brother heard the wonderful words of the selfrealised sage and exclaimed, 'How strange '
When the sage Dharmabrata was telling the story, Rama saw a hermitage strewn all over with kusa grass and bark garments, and endowed with pure brahminic grace.
Illustrious Rama accompanied by Vaidehi and Lakshmana entered the hermitage and, honoured by all the sages, stayed there.
Rama, the scion of the Kakutstha race, wielder of great weapons, stayed in that beautiful hermitage, accepting the hospitality of the sages extended with due honour, He visited in turn their penancegroves where he repeated his stay.
Rama lived happily here for about ten months, there one year, here four or five or six months and there over one or half a month or three or eight months in another.
Thus enjoying their stay in the hermitages, Rama, Sita and Lakshmana spent ten favourable years.
Rama went round who was full of grace and full of knowledge on dharma went round with Sita and came back to Suthikshna's hermitage.
On his arrival, Rama, the subduer of enemies, was honoured by the sages at the hermitage where he stayed for a short time.
Once while sitting beside sage Sutikshna at the hermitage Rama humbly addressed him:
I have heard others saying that lord Agastya, the great sage, lives in this forest.
I am unable to locate the sacred hermitage of that sagacious sage due to the vastness of this forest.
By your grace, I wish to go there with Sita and my brother Lakshmana to offer our respectful salutations.
There is a great desire  in my heart to serve in person the best of sages, Agastya.
Hearing the words of Rama, the righteous son of Dasaratha, sage Sutikshna was pleased to reply:
I also wished you, O Raghava, to visit Agastya along with Sita and Lakshmana.
Luckily you have asked me on your own. I will tell you where the great sage Agastya lives.
Dear Rama, walk from here a distance of four yojanas. There in the southerly direction  stands the great, beautiful hermitage of Agastya's brother.
This plain land in the beautiful forest tract is adorned with fig trees,filled with  flowers, fruits, and delightful sounds of different birds.
O Rama, there are lotusponds filled with clear, sacred waters, with different kinds of swans, ducks and ruddy geese. Spend one night there and proceed early in the morning.
If you go in the southern direction for a yojana you will find Agasthya's hermitage by the side of a cluster of trees.
Vaidehi will feel happy in your company in that delightful forest region full of many trees.So too will Lakshmana.
O glorious one, if you have made up your mind to visit that great sage Agastya, think of starting today itself.
Rama heard the words of the sage, offered him reverential salutations and set out along with his brother and Sita.
Enjoying the sight of delightful forests, cloudlike mountains, lakes and rivers on the  way, and following the directions given by  Sutikshna, Rama was happy. He said  to Lakshmana:
Surely this is the hermitage of great Agastya's brother, a man of holy deeds.
This is the glade we were told about with thousands of trees drooping down with abundant fruits and flowers.
Feel this sudden astringent smell of ripe figs wafted by the breeze from the forest.
Heaps of firewood are seen here and there on the path. There are blades of grass (used for sacrificial ceremonies) shining like vaidurya (gems).
In the middle of the forest can be seen like the tip of the dark clouds columns of smoke coming out of the top of hermitages.
Priests are coming out of the solitary sacred spots after their bath and making offerings of flowers they had themselves plucked.
O handsome one, surely this is the hermitage of Agastya's brother about which I heard from Sutikshna.
Assuming the form of a brahmin and using Sanskrit language, Ilvala would invite brahmins for offering shraddha to the dead
Ilvala would keep his brother sanctified, so that he is fit for offering, Then he would feed the brahmins with mutton according to the rituals.
Then when the brahmins finished eating, Ilvala would call aloud, 'O Vatapi come out'.
Then hearing his brother's voice, Vatapi would bleat like a sheep and jump out, tearing open the bodies of those brahmins.
In this manner, thousands of brahmins used to be killed daily by those carnivorous demons who assumed any form at their free will.
Urged by the gods, Agastya  came  for the shradda . The mighty demon played the same routine trick and Vatapi, for sure, was eaten by the great sage.
Saying, the ritual is complete Ilvala offered water in the palm of Agastya and called his brother to come out.
Wise Agastya,  the best among the ascetics, laughing aloud, said to Ilvala, the destroyer of brahmins:
I have digested the demon Vatapi your brother, who assumed the form of a sheep. He has reached the abode of Yama, Lord of death. Where does he have the power to come out?
On hearing the news of the death of his brother, the demon Ilvala, out of anger, started attacking the sage.
Ilvala who pounced upon Agastya, the best among the sages whose lustre lay consumed by the fire of his eyes which were in flames.
This hermitage surrounded by beautiful lakes and forests belongs to his brother (Sudarsana). Out of sympathy for Agastya, he has accomplished this difficult task.
While Rama was thus narrating to Lakshmana (the story of Agastya), the Sun set and evening closed in.
Rama with his brother Lakshmana duly offered oblations at twilight, entered the hermitage and greeted the sage (Sudarsana) with folded palms.
Warmly received by the sage, Rama shared the roots and fruits and slept the night there.
When the night passed and the Sun became bright, Rama took leave of the brother of Agastya.
O Lord, the night has been wellspent. Now we humbly seek leave of you to see your respectable elder brother.
With his permission, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, proceeded along the path indicated, watching (the beauty of) the forest.
They passed by wild rice fields, jackfruit trees, palmyra and various other trees like Ashoka, trees with white flowers, old trees that existed for a long time, mahva trees, bilva trees and tindukas.
Rama saw hundreds of trees crushed by the trunks of elephants and by monkeys. He saw some trees echoing with notes of hundreds of intoxicated birds. He saw tree tops coiled with creepers in full bloom.
Then the lotuseyed Rama said to the chivalrous, graceful Lakshmana who stood behind him:
The leaves of the trees here are glossy, the animals and birds are peaceful. It appears the hermitage of the selfrealized great sage Agastya is not very far from here.
Here is the hermitage of Agastya, wellknown in the world for his deeds a place of rest for those tired with hard work.
This forest is enveloped with the smoke rising from the sacrificial altar. There are rows of bark robes hanging. Herds of quiet animals lying and different kind of birds chirping around.
This is his hermitage. On account of his (Agastya's) impact the demons look south but cannot eat the hermits out of fear (for the sage).
Since the time Agastya of sacred deeds occupied this direction the demons are quiet, leaving all enmity.
The southern side favourable to the people was famous by the name Agastya in the three worlds and stood unassailable to the demons.
This is the hermitage of the longlived Agastya who is renowned for his deeds and is served by humble people. The great mountain Vindhya that was growing incessantly and obstructing the path of the Sun stopped growing any more in obedience to Agastya's words.
We are going to join this sage honoured by the people of the world and ever engaged in the welfare of the virtuous. This augurs well for us.
O noble, handsome Lakshmana, I will spend the rest of the exile in this forest in the worship of the great sage Agastya.
The gods along with gandharvas, siddhas and great sages always serve Agastya, observing discipine in their food habits.
This sage is such type that he (his spiritual power) will not allow a liar or a cruel man or a deceitful or lustful  or wicked person to thrive here.
Here gods, yakshas, nagas and birds live, following the righteous path and observing discipline in food habits.
Here great souls like sages and siddhas gave up the ghost and with renewed bodies left for heaven on aerochariot resembling the Sun (in brightness).
Worshipped by benevolent beings, the gods here bestow on them the status of demigods or of the immortals or several kinds of kingdoms.
Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama,  entered the hermitage of Agastya and met one of his disciples and said to him these words :
The valiant eldest son of  king Dasaratha has come along with his wife Sita to see the sage.
I am his younger brother Lakshmana, his wellwisher and faithful devotee if you have at all heard about me.
By the command of our father, we have entered this dense forest and desire to see the   divine sire. Please report.
The ascetic heard Lakshmana, and saying, 'let it be so', entered the firesanctuary to report.
Having promptly entered, Agastya's favourite disciple with folded hands reported as he was told by Lakshmana about Rama's arrival to the great sage who was armed with the inviolable powers of penance :
Rama and Lakshmana, the two sons of Dasaratha along with Sita, wife of Rama, have arrived at the hermitage.
Both the subduers of enemies  have come here now to see and serve your Holiness. You may order what is to be done next.
Having heard from the disciple about the arrival of Rama, Lakshmana and great daughter of the king of Videha the sage said :
It is good fortune that Rama has come here after a long time to see me. I was longing for his arrival.
Go quickly and with due hospitality conduct Rama, his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana into my presence. Why was he not ushered in so long?
'So be it ' said the disciple respectfully with folded palms in response to what the great sage, knower of dharma, commanded.
Then the disciple in a state of excitement came out of the hermitage and said to Lakshmana, 'Where is Rama? Let him come himself to see the sage'.
Then Lakshmana reached the entrance of the hermitage with the disciple  and showed  Rama of the Kakutstha race and Sita, daughter of Janaka .
The disciple humbly reported Agastya's words and ushered him in with befitting hospitality.
Then Rama, Sita and Lakshmana entered the hermitage, watching herds of quietly moving deer (undisturbed by their entry).
Rama saw at the hermitage, the places (altars) of Brahma, Visnu, Agni (firegod), Indra, Sun, Moon, Bhaga, Kubera, Dhata (supreme spirit), Vidhata (creator Brahman), Vayu (Windgod), Ananta (great serpentking),  Gayatri, Vasu Pasahasta, Varuna, Kartikeya and Dharma .
Thereafter surrounded by the disciples the sage came out. Rama saw him coming in front of the effulgent sages.
The valiant Rama said to Lakshmana, the enhancer of prosperity, O Lakshmana, sage Agastya is coming out. By virtue of his noble appearance, I know this sage to be a great treasuretrove of penances.
Having said so, the mightyarmed Rama, the scorcher of enemies, grasped the feet of Agastya who was shining like the Sun.
Then righteous Rama with Sita, the princess of Videha, and Lakshmana offered respects with folded palmsstanding.
Agastya received Rama by offering him seat and water, enquired about his wellbeing  and said: Please be seated,
After giving oblations to the fire, and  providing respectful offerings, the sage worshipped the guests according to the tradition of hermits and served them food.
And then the great sage Agastya, knower of dharma  first took his seat and addressed Rama, an export in the knowledge of dharma, seated with folded palms.
O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, only  after offering oblations to the Firegod, a guest should be worshipped with water etc. Otherwise the host will have to eat his own flesh in the other world like a false witness.
You are king of all the worlds, a follower of dharma, a great warrior worthy of worship and an esteemed self. O Rama you are such a dear guest come to me.
Having said this to Rama, (the sage) honoured him by offering fruits, roots, flowers and other things as desired. He then said to Rama once again:
O best among men  this divine bow studded with gold and gems  belongs to Visnu and designed by Visvakarma. This excellent, unfailing arrow, bright like the Sun, was given to me by Brahma.
These two quivers filled fully with sharp inexhaustible arrows, shining like flames of fire and this sword adorned with gold and this big silver sheath were given to me by Indra.
In ancient times Visnu killed the demons in a battle with this bow and brought back the glittering prosperity for the gods.
O bestower of honour, receive this bow, the two quivers, the sword and the arrow for your victory just like Indra accepts the thunderbolt.
The luminous lord Agastya, having said this, gave all the excellent weapons to Rama. And continued :   इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वादशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
O Rama ,I am pleased. I wish you well. I am glad that both of you have come here with Sita to pay respect to me.
Both of you are tired due to the journey. It is evident that Sita, daughter of Janaka, is anxious (to rest).
Even though delicate, Sita never feels discouraged by difficulties. She has come to the forest full of obstacles, since she is motivated by her love for her husband.
O Rama, help Sita enjoy herself in whatever manner she likes. By following you into the forest, she has accomplished the most difficult task৷৷
O Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty from the beginning of the creation women, by nature,  keep the husband company when all goes well and give them up when hard times come.
Women are fickle like lightning, sharp like weapons and fast like Garuda or the windgod.
Your wife is free from such blemishes. She is praiseworthy and worthy of mention as an example just like the revered Arundhati.
O Rama, subduer of enemies the place where you reside along with Lakshmana and Vaidehi will look adorned, indeed.
Thus addressed, Rama held his palms together and said politely to the sage shining like fire:
I consider myself blessed and favoured by a great sage like you, bestower of boons as you have been pleased with me, my brother and my life.
Direct me to a place with water and dense forest where we can build an ashram and live happily.
On hearing the words of Rama, Agastya, the best among the sages, coolheaded and righteous, thought a while and uttered these words coolly :
O dear two yojanas away is a place wellknown as Panchavati, a beautiful resort with many roots, fruits, plenty of water and many animals.
Reaching there, you wikk build a hermitage with Lakshmana and enjoy your life given to the fulfilment of the pledge to the father.
O Rama, scion of the Kakutsthas  much of the period of exile king Dasaratha had assigned has passed. You will fulfil your promise and live happily in the kingdom.
O Rama, joy of the Raghu family with the eldest son like you, your father is blessed and liberated like king Yayati.
O sinless one, I have kown all these facts about you by the power of penance and love for Dasaratha.
I know your heart by virtue of my penance. I, therefore, ask you to proceed to Panchavati, after ensuring your stay here with me in this penancegrove for the time being.
O Raghava, that forest tract is delightful and beautiful. It is not far away(from here). Maithili (Sita) will enjoy her stay there.
O longarmed Rama,that place has plenty of roots and fruits. It is a solitary, holy and beautiful place teeming with various kinds of birds. Sita will enjoy her stay in the vicinity of river Godavari.
O Rama, while staying with your wife, you will look after the ascetics living there since you are capable of giving protection.
O valiant Rama look at the great forest of madhuka trees. Walk north to the forest till you see a great banyan tree.
Then climb the elevated ground not very far from the mountain. There is the wellknown Panchavati with forests, ever in full bloom.
Thus addressed by Agastya,  Rama with Lakshmana paid respects to the sage wedded to truth and took leave of him.
Both of them worshipped the feet of sage Agastya, and proceeded to Panchavati with his permission.
Both the princes, unafraid of battles, held their bows, tied the quivers and carefully proceeded towards Panchavati along the path suggested by the sage.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयोदशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On the way to Panchavati, Rama, the delight of the Raghu race, met a vulture with a huge body and fearful strength.
Seeing the bird on the banyan tree, venerable Rama and Lakshmana mistook him for a demon and enquired who he was.
With a sweet, pleasing, and gentle voice he said to both of them, O dear know me to be a friend of your father.
Rama knew he was a friend of his father. So he enquired in a cool, composed voice his name and his lineage.
On hearing Rama's words, the bird started narrating the origin of all beings including his own family:
O mightyarmed Rama hear from me while I am telling you about the lords of creation from the very beginning.
O Rama among the lords of all beings the first was Kardama, the next was Vikritha, followed by Sesha, Samsrya Bahuputra, Sthanu, Mareechi, Atri and mighty Kratu, Pulastya, Angirasa, Pracheta, similarly Pulaha and Daksha.Following them were Vivasvan, Arishtanemi and the very glorious Kasyapa who was the last ruler.
O glorious Rama it is wellknown that Daksha, the creator had sixty daughters of great fame.
Out of them(daughters of Daksha) Kasyapa married eight women of beautiful waist called Aditi, Diti, Danu also Kalika,Tamra, Krodhavasa, Anala and Manu.
Kasyapa, pleased with them said to his young wives, Beget sons of my stature who can rule over the three worlds.
O best of men, O longarmed Rama while Aditi, Diti and Kalika seriously considered his advice, the rest of the wives did not.
O Rama, subduer and scorcher of enemies to Aditi were born twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and two Asvins, thirtythree deities in all.
O dear Rama, Diti bore glorious sons called Daityas and this earth with all the forests and seas belonged to them.
O subduer of enemies, to Danu was born Hayagriva and to Kalika, Naraka and Kalaka.
To Tamra were born, Krounchi, Bhasi, Syeni, Dhrutharashtri and Suki. Altogether they were five beautiful young maids famous in the world.
Krounchi gave birth to owls, Bhasi to Bhasa birds, Synei to bright hawks and vultures, Dhrutharashtri to swans and chakravakas with sweet notes.
Dhrutharashtri, a female bird of great lustre gave birth to chakravakas too. Suki gave birth to Nata and from Nata, Vinata was born. Be blessed, O Rama
O Ramato Krodhavasa were born Mrugi, Mrugamanda, Hari, Bhadramada, Mathangi, Sardooli, Sweta, Surabhi and Surasa, Kadruva and endowed with all virtues.
O best of men, all kinds of animals were born of Mrugi.To Mrugamanda were born bears and chamara (a different kind of deer).
To Hari were born lions, and swiftmoving monkeys and to Bhadramada, a daughter by name Iravati.
O bull among men Matangi gave birth to elephants.The mighty elephant Airavata who became the lord of the world was born to Iravati.
O Rama, Sarduli gave birth to tigers and playful, roundbodied monkeys called Golangula and Sweta delivered elephants as sons for guarding the eight quarters.
Surabhi gave birth to Rohini and Gandharvi,the two famous daughters. May you be happy, Rama
O Rama Rohini procreated cows, and Gandharvi, horses as offsprings. Surasa delivered cobras and Kadru, ordinary serpents.
O Rama, bull among men Manu procreated brahmins, kshatriyas, vaisyas and sudras all famed human beings.
Anala (wife of Kasyapa) procreated trees with sacred fruits. Vinata was the granddaughter of Suki, and Kahdruva and Surasa were her sisters.
Kadhru produced a thousandhooded serpent(Adisesha) who held the whole earth on his head and Vinata, two sons, Garuda and Aruna.
I am born to Aruna and my elder brother is Sampati. O subduer of enemies, know me as Jatayu, son of Syeni.
If you so desire I will be helpful to you in guarding your hut. O dear, it is a difficult forest full of wild animals and demons. When you and Lakshmana are away I will protect Sita.
Rama worshipped  Jatayu and bending down, embraced him. He heard from him again and again several events relating to Jatayu's  friendship with his father.
Entresting the protection of Sita, the princess of Mithila, to that strong vulture,  Jatayu, and accompanied by Lakshmana Rama went to Panchavati wishing to destroy the enemies like fire burning the moths.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामयणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुर्दशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On reaching Panchavati, which was full of various vicious animals, Rama said to Lakshmana, his brother who was glowing like  fire:
O handsome one, following the directions of the great sage, we have arrived at Panchavati, a place full of blossoming trees.
O Lakshmana cast your eyes all around the forest for a suitable place (for building a hermitage).  Indeed, you are good at judging things.
Look, O Lakshmana  for a place to the liking of Sita, a place where there is water source nearby  where both of us can enjoy. Find a beautiful location where the surrounding forest is beautiful and where faggots, flowers, water and kusa grass are available at hand.
Having been thus instructed by Rama, Lakshmana said with folded palms in the presence of Sita:
O Rama, I shall be dependent on you, even if I live for a hundred years. You only need to indicate a beautiful place of your choice.
Rama was pleased with the words of great Lakshmana. Deliberating over it, he agreed upon a site suitable in all respects.
Having come to a beautiful spot suitable for the asram, Rama took both the hands of  Lakshmana in his own and said:
This place is level, surrounded by beautiful trees in full bloom. O handsome one, you may build the hermitage here.
There, not very far, is a beautiful lotustank shining like the Sun, fragrant with lotuses.
As said by the selfrealised soul, sage Agastya, this Godavari is beautiful, surrounded by trees with flowers in bloom, filled with flocks of swans, ducks and ruddy geese.
O handsome one, neither far nor near are seen tall mountains and flowering trees and herds of deer. Their numerous caves echo with sounds of peacocks.
These mountains, with streaks of minerals like gold, silver and copper forming decorative designs, look beautiful like colourful windows, and appear like huge elephants.
The place is covered with  sal and palmyrah trees including mango, jackfruit, dates, kadamba, punnaga, ashoka, champak, tilaka, ketaka, sandalwood, spandan, dhava, asvakarna parnasha, khadira, sami, kimsuka and patala trees. It is full of wild paddy, flowering bushes and creepers that run on the ground.
This is a holy place fit for sacrifice. There are many animals and birds here.Hence we will reside here with Jatayu.
Thus directed by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana, destroyer  of enemy warriors, soon built a hermitage for his brother.
Lakshmana who was quick to act dug the clay with nippers, planted long bamboo poles, put branches of sami trees across and tied them with strong ropes. He spread kusa and kasa grass and leaves on the levelled ground. He built a beautiful, spacious and nice residence for Rama.
Lakshmana then went to river Godavari, had his bath, and returned with some lotuses.
Lakshmana offered oblation of flowers, invoked peace as per tradition (before occupying a newly made home) and showed Rama the cottage he had built.
Rama and Sita saw the beautiful hermitage built by Lakshmana, and expressed much happiness over the leafthatched cottage.
Deeply pleased with Lakshmana, he hugged him tightly and said those loving words :
O my master, you have done a great task for which I have given you what I could give at the moment a hug.
O Lakshmana with a son like you who can understand others' feelings, who has a sense of gratitude and a sense of duty my father is not dead yet.
Rama who was an enhancer of fortunes and who had his senses under control said thus to Lakshmana and lived happily there in that place filled with fruits.
Righteous Rama, served by Lakshmana, and Sita lived there for some time like a god in heaven. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चदशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While the great self Rama  lived happily there, autumn passed and dear winter set in.
Once Rama, delight of the Raghu race, went to the beautiful river Godavari for ablution in the early hours of the morning.
While valiant Lakshmana, walking behind Sita who was carrying a pitcher in her hand bent down a little and told Rama thus:
O sweetspeaking brother, the season which is dear to you has arrived. It appears the auspicious year is going to be embellished with this season.
People feel frozen with fog, and water is no more enjoyable. The earth is full of crops and fire is so agreeable.
Pious men offer their libations of the first crop at Agnistoma sacrifice and thereby please their manes and get rid of their sins.
People in the countryside with their desires satisfied obtain abundant cow's milk at this time. Rulers of the earth are out on their expedition with a desire for victory.
As the Sun has resorted to the direction (south) that serves the god of death, the north devoid of (the Sun) shines like a woman without the vermilion mark on the forehead.
Presently with the Sun far away, the Himalayas abounding in snow has naturally justified its name.
The days are enjoyable at noon as it is pleasant to move about during this time since the sun is not scorching. But the shade and water seem to be unfortunate (as they are not liked by any one.
The days will be frostsmitten. The Sun will also be mild. Due to heavy dewfall the weather will be cold with the blowing of the wind. Forests will be empty (as no animals would be seen moving around.)
At this time people do not sleep under the open sky. With the month of Pushya approaching, nights feel cool and look red due to frost. They prolong into three yamas.
With the radiance of the Sun dimmed, with its orb reddened by frost, the moon does not shine clear like a mirror blurred with breath.
On a fullmoon night the beams of the moon faded by forest look pale, dull like Sita scorched by the heat of the Sun.
The west wind which by nature feels cold at this time blows doubly cold, hit by snow.
The snowcold forest terrains are fertile with barley and wheat crops. As the Sun rises the swans and kraunchas produce pleasing notes.
The tops of rice crops shining like gold resemble the flowers of datepalm.The fields full of ripe paddy bending a little (under the weight of grains) look delightful.
The Sun risen at the distant horizon looks like the Moon, his lengthening rays covered with snow and dew.
The heat of the Sun which we do not feel in the forenoon is comfortable during midday when the Sun shines slightly reddish white on earth.
As the miadows are wet with dewdrops, the land looks delightful with mild Sunlight  shining on the surface.
The wild tusker, extremely thirsty, touches the clean, cold water joyfully, but immediately withdraws its trunk unable to bear the cold.
Just as inefficient warriors do not enter the warfield, aquatic birds sitting near water do not venture to take a plunge into it.
The flowerless forest ranges appear as if they are asleep, enveloped in the darkness of frost and  snow .
Now the rivers are not visible as the waters are covered with vapour. They are only inferred through the cackling of swans and the sands of the bank moistened with dewdrops.
Due to snowfall, mildness of the Sun, and coldness (of weather) even the water flowing from the mountain top is not generally tasty.
The lotuses in the tank  no more shine (bright) as they are decayed by age, their filaments and pericarps withered with only stalks remaining.
At this time, righteous Bharata, the best among men, with his devotion to you must be sadly performing penance at his residence.
Giving up his kingdom, honour and pleasures of many kinds, Bharata will be living like an ascetic, sleeping on the ground in cold weather, his food under restriction.
At this time, Bharata,  accompanied by his subjects, must be daily going to river Sarayu for ablution.
How can Bharata who was brought up in luxury, who is delicate, and deserves all comfort, take a dip in river Sarayu (in cold morning) ?
He has a blue complexion, a pair of eyes like lotus petals, a thin waist and long arms. He is selfrestrained, softspoken, sweettempered and truthful. He knows his duty and maintains a low profile. A subduer  of enemies, he is heroic and great. Such Bharata has given up the diverse pleasures of life and has surrendered himself to you with all his soul.
Although you dwell in the forest, your great brother Bharata has won the kingdom of heaven by faithfully adopting your asceticism.
The saying that men follow mother's path but not the path of the father, has been disproved by Bharata.
How could mother Kaikeyi, who has a husband like Dasaratha and a noble son like Bharata, be so wicked by nature ?
When pious Lakshmana said thus to Rama out of his love for him, Rama replied, unable to tolerate the words of censure against mother (Kaikeyi) :
O dear, Kaikeyi, our second mother, is never to be criticised like that. You may, however, speak more of Bharata, the lord of the Iksvakus.
Even though I have made up my mind to dwell in the forest and keep my vow, my love for Bharata makes me waver like a child (Rama does not want Bharata to suffer on his account).
I remember his dear, sweet, ambrosial  words, soothing to the heart and pleasing to the mind.
O enhancer of joy of the Raghus  when shall I meet great Bharata, brave Satrughna and you all together?
Expressing his grief in such manner, Rama reached Godavari where he took his bath with his brother and Sita.
And then poised, they offered libations of water to their forefathers and gods and prayer to the rising Sun.
Accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana,Rama finished his bath in the river.He looked splendid like Lord Rudra followed by Nandi and the daughter of the king of  the mountains (Parvati). इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षोडशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Ablution over, Rama, accompanied by Sita and Lakshmana, went back from the bank of the river Godabari to their hermitage.
On reaching the hermitage, Rama and Lakshmana performed the forenoon rituals and entered the leafthatched cottage.
Honoured by the ascetics , Rama  stayed there peacefully with brother Lakshmana, discussing diverse matters (from time to time).
Longarmed Rama seated with Sita in the cottage, appeared like the Moon in conjunction with constellation Chitra.
While Rama was thus seated, engrossed in conversation, there incidentally appeared a demoness.
Surpanakha, sister of the tenheaded demon (Ravana) approached Rama shining like a god.
The demoness was infatuated with Rama,  whose chest was like that of a lion, who was strongarmed, who had a glowing face, pleasing to the eyes, who walked with the gait of an elephant, whose hair was matted,  who was gentle and strong who was, endowed with royal traits, who had a blue lotuslike complexion, who was handsome as the god of love, and who resembled Indra.
Rama's face was lovely, Surpanakha's was hideous. Rama had a slender waist, she had a huge belly. His eyes were large,  hers were deformed. His hair was black and beautiful, hers was coppercoloured. He was lovely in appearance, she was ugly. His voice was sweet, hers was shrill. He was young, she was dreadfully old. He was positive, she was perverted. Rama was wellbehaved, she was wicked. Rama was just and loving while she was overcome by lust.  (This) demoness said to Rama :
O Rama you are wearing matted hair like an ascetic, but living with your wife and holding bow and arrows. What brings you to this place haunted by demons ? You should tell me the truth ?
Thus asked by the demoness Surpanakha,  Rama, scorcher of foes began telling her everything due to his simplemindedness.
To Rama untruth is never acceptable at the hermitage and especially in the presence of a woman.
(Rama replied) There was a king named Dasaratha who was mighty like the gods. I am his eldest son known among the people as Rama.
Here is Lakshmana , my younger brother, who always follows me . And this  is the daughter of the king of Videha and my wife, wellknown as Sita.
I have come here, commanded by the king, my father and mother.Intending to obey the orders of my father, and impelled by duty to  establish righteousness I have come  to reside here.
I wish to know who you are. Tell me who your kins are. With lovely limbs you do not appear to be a demoness.
Tell me truly what you have come here for. Having heard the words of Rama and overtaken by passion, the demoness said:
My name is Surpanakha. I am a demoness who can assume any form at will, I move in this forest alone, unleashing a reign of terror.
My brother is Ravana, son of Visrava, and lord of all demons. You have heard his name I suppose.
Kumbhakarna is another brother of mine. He is very strong. He is always in deep sleep. Vibhisna another brother. He is righteous free from  any demoniac trait. My other two brothers are Khara and Dusana who are wellknown heroes of war.
Setting them aside, I came here, as soon as I saw you. You are the finest among men and I am here wishing you to be my husband.
I have influence over others, I have capacity to move wherever I want. Be my husband forever. What will you do with Sita?
She is ugly, deformed, unsuitable for you. I  am alone  fit for you. Look upon me as your wife.
I will devour your brother along with this disfigured, unchaste and fearful lady with a flat belly.
O darling, thereafter you can keep wandering with me in this Dandaka forest, enjoying the beauty of the mountain tops and forests.
Thus addressed, Rama, skilled in speech, laughed and started speaking to that woman of bewitching eyes.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तदशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
To  Surpanakha bound by the noose of passion Rama with a smile replied in a clear, lucid manner:
O lady I am married and here is my wife who is dear to me. To be a cowife to some one is indeed painful for people like you.
Here is my younger brother Lakshmana. He is a man of good conduct, good look, valiant and virtuous. (Besides) he is not with his wife.
He is not with his wife, and is in need of one. He is young, handsome and worthy. He will be an appropriate husband to you.
O  woman of large eyes and fine hips, my brother is fit for you. You will (with him) shine like the radiant Sun on mount Meru. You will enjoy yourself without a cowife. You may approach him.
Thus  told by Rama, the demoness, deluded with lust, left him suddenly, and said to Lakshmana:
With my fine complexion, I will be a suitable wife for you. You can happily wander about in Dandaka forest with me.
Thus addressed by the demoness Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, wellversed in the use of words gave her a befitting reply :
O lotuscomplexioned woman , how can you act as a maid to a slave ? Why do you intend to be so? I am already dependent on my revered brother.
O largeeyed one, you have a clear complexion. You may become the younger wife of my master who is lord of great wealth. And live a happy, fulfilled life.
He will abandon this uglylooking, unchaste, frightening old woman of drooping belly and accept you alone as his wife.
O lady of fair complexion and beautiful hips, which wise man will fall in love with any other female giving up a fine figure like you ?
While Lakshmana was thus making fun of the dreadful, droopingbellied Surpanakha, she presumed his words to be true.
Deluded with passion, Surpanakha said to formidable Rama, the scorcher of foes,  seated in the leafthatched hut along with Sita:
I shall eat up this woman now before your very eyes and I can move about happily with you without a cowife.
While speaking this, Surpanakha, with eyes like flaming amber ran to the fawneyed Sita in great anger like a giant meteor hurtling towards the constellation of Rohini :
Mighty Rama in a rage restrained her who was falling upon Sita like the noose of death, and said to Lakshmana:
O handsome Lakshmana it is not proper to cut jokes with wicked, uncivilized persons. Now see Sita who has somehow survived.
O tiger among men, this uncouth, bigbellied, unchaste and highly passionate demoness deserves to be formed.
Thus instructed (by Rama), powerful Lakshmana took position by the side of Rama, angrily lifted the sword and cut off her nose and ears.
Dreadful Surpanakha with her ears and nose cut off, roared in a hoarse voice and ran away into the forest in the same direction as she came.
The dreadful demoness who thus was disfigured. Drenched in blood, she  thundered like a cloud in rainy season.
Dripping blood profusely, the frightful demoness lifted her arms and entered the great forestroaring.
A disfigured demoness, she fell down like the thunderbolt from the sky on the ground while her fiercelooking brother Khara sat surrounded by demons at Janasthana.
Thereafter the sister of Khara, wild with fear and delusion and drenched in blood, narrated all about the arrival of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in the forest and her disfigurement.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टादशस्सर्ग।।Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Burning with anger to see his sister fallen down disfigured and drenched in blood, Khara enquired:
Get up, give up your confusion and stupefaction. Tell me clearly by whom you have been disfigured like this ?
Who will hurt  an innocent, venomous black serpent and stay away quietly close by for fun with his finger tip?
Who is he who has tied has tied his throat with the noose of death out of ignorance and yet does not know the implications ? Who is he who has caused this injury to you, but does not understand that he has drunk deadly poison.
You have sufficient strength and courage. You are capable of  moving as you like and taking any form at your will. By whom have you been brought to this state and drawn close to death?
Which valiant person among gods, gandharvas, sages and other great people, has disfigured you like this ?
I can see none in this world who can offend me, nor even the thousandeyed Indra among the gods.
Just as the swan drinks only milk from water (mixed with milk), my arrows will (unerringly) drain the life from the enemy's body right now.
Whose foamy, red blood will the earth drink while I strike his vital organs with my arrows in the fight ?
Whose flesh will be eaten by cheerful flocks of (vultures), biting and tearing his body when he is killed by me in the battle ?
Neither gods nor devils nor gandharvas nor even demons will have the power to rescue that hapless creature dragged by me ruthlessly in the battle.
You should tell me as you slowly regain your consciousness which bragart has overpowered you in the forest with his strength.
On hearing her angry brother, Surpanakha replied with words choked with tears:
Here are two young sons of Dasaratha, Rama and Lakshmana, who are gentle, handsome,  strong, with eyes like white lotus, wearing deerskin and bark robes, living on fruits and roots, selfrestrained like ascetics and following the righteous path.
They are kings of the gandharvas with all royal insignia. I was not able to discern whether they are gods or humans.
I saw between them a young, beautiful woman of slender waist, adorned with all kinds of jewels.
I have been subjected to this state of an orphan unfaithful woman by both of them for the sake of that lady.
I wish to drink the foamy blood of that crooked woman and of both the brothers slain on the battle front.
O dear  this is my first wish and you must fulfil it. I will drink her blood and  of the two brothers, in the battle.
As she was speaking, the inflamed Khara ordered fourteen very strong demons, comparable to Yama, the god of death, to proceed.
Two human beings equipped with weapons, clad in bark robes and deerskin have entered the dreadful Dandaka forest along with a woman of bewitching beauty.
I want you to get  both of them along with that notorious woman killed. This sister of mine will drink their blood.
O demons quickly go and crush them with your power and fulfil my sister's sincere wish.
Thus commanded, the fourteen demons along with Surpanakha rushed there like windblown clouds.
The nightrangers were unable to crush him(Rama) despite their sharp, glowing weapons  just as wild elephants cannot face all at once the rising flame of the forest fire.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The frightful Surpanakha came to the hermitage of Rama and showed both the brothers and Sita to the demons.
They saw mighty Rama together with Vaidehi and Lakshmana sitting in the leafthatched cottage.
Seeing the demons along with Surpanakha arrive, said the handsome Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty to his brother Lakshmana, who was blazing like fire :
O Lakshmana  stand by Sita for a while. I shall kill these demons who have come here.
Lakshmana heard him and in turn honoured the word of Rama, knower of the self.
Righteous Rama too, lifted up his great bow decked with gold and fastened the string and then said to the demons:
We, Rama and Lakshmana, sons of Dasaratha, are brothers, who have entered the inaccessible Dandaka forest along with Sita.
Feeding on fruits and roots and following the righteous path, we are living in Dandaka forest like ascetics. Why are you torturing us?
I came here equipped with bows, arrows and weapons, asked by ascetics to kill in the battle sinners like you who are offending them.
If you care for your life, you may return, or else, if you please you may remain (die) here, O demons.
At these words, the destroyers of brahmins, the fourteen demons were inflamed. They lifted their spears and spoke:
You have incited the wrath of Khara, our great master for which you will now pay with your life in the fight.
How can you face us alone? We outnumber you? Leave alone fighting, you cannot even stand in front of us.
Come on with daggers and sharpedged spears hurled, you will give up your life,your prowess as well as the bow held in your hand.
Saying these words, the fourteen infuriated demons hurled their spears at invincible Rama.
All the fourteen spears hurled turned into splinters by the same number of golden arrows released by Rama.
Then the effulgent Rama, mighty angry, took fourteen arrows sharpened by stones and glowing like the  Sun.
Rama took the bow, stretched it and aimed at his target, the demons  and sent the arrows as Indra would release the thunderbolt.
Goldfeathered blazing arrows decorated with gold, released by Rama flew fast and pierced the chests of the demons. Drenched in blood they (the arrows) thundered (out of their chests) and  plunged into the earth.
With their hearts split, their bodies drenched in blood, disfigured and lifeless, the demons fell down on earth like trees cut  at the roots.
Seeing the demons fallen on the ground, the demoness wild with anger and fear roared.
Her blood slightly dried up, she came back afflicted to Khara and fell down like a sallaki tree, its sap oozing.
Missing
Then desperately screaming and shedding tears with a sad face beside her brother, she roared again and again.
When Surpanakha saw the demons fall dead on the battleground, she ran to Khara,her brother and told in detail about the death of the demons.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे विंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Seeing Surpanakha collapse, Khara said in clear terms about the unfortunate situation she had created:
The valiant demons who feed on blood have been commissioned for your pleasure. Why are you crying again?
They are loyal and faithful to me. They are always my wellwishers. Even when attacked, they cannot be killed. They never fail to carry out my orders.
I wish to know what makes you lament and roll on the ground like a serpent and hissing?
When I am here like a lord to protect you, why do you weep like an orphan? Get up. Give up your anxiety. Be not afraid.
Thus consoled by Khara, invincible Surpanakha wiped her tearful eyes and said to her brother:
My ears and nose sliced off, drenched with blood, I came to you and you pacified me.
O warrior  you had sent, out of anger, fourteen demons to put an end to Rama along with Lakshmana in order to please me.
The demons who went with spears in their hands were killed, their hearts pierced by  Rama's arrows.
Seeing the powerful demons collapse on the ground in a moment's time through Rama's action, I was frightened.
O demon  I am scared and sad. To me everything looks frightening. I, therefore, seek refuge in you.
I am drowned in a vast sea of sorrow where crocodiles in the form of distress reside. It is full of rows of waves of fright. Why do you not save me?
The demons who live on flesh, who came following me fell down on earth and lay dead,  shot by the sharp arrows of Rama.
O demon  if you have compassion for me or for the demons, if you have the power and energy to face Rama, kill the enemy of the demons living in Dandaka forest.
If now you do not kill that Rama, my enemy, O shameless one, I will give up my life in your very presence.
Instinctively I can foresee that you and your army do not have the capability to encounter that great Rama in a fight.
You call yourself a hero, yet are not able to kill two humans like Rama and Lakshmana. Your claim to heroism is false. You are not a hero at all.
O demon  you are a disgrace to the family. If you have power or energy, kill that Rama dwelling in Dandaka forest.
You have little strength and less heroism. You with your relations should immediately leave Janasthana. What kind of position do you have here?
Let down by the brilliance of Rama, son of Dasaratha, you will be soon destroyed. He is mighty and his brother who has disfigured me is very valiant.
Overcome by sorrow, the bigbellied demoness cried  in several ways and being very sad started beating her chest with both hands.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकविंशस्सर्गः।Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Ashamed and accused thus in the presence of the demons, the valiant Khara spoke to Surpanakha in harsh words:
Like the overslowing salt sea water, I am unable to contain this my excessive anger arising out of your insult.
Rama is a shortlived human. I do not care for his valour. His life span will be shortened (he will be killed) now for his own misdeeds.
Restrain your tears and your anxieties I will send Rama along with his brother to the abode of Yama.
With his life ebbing out, killed by my axe in the fight, you will drink today, O demoness, Rama's red, hot blood.
On hearing the words that came out of Khara's mouth, she was pleased. And in stupidity began praising her brother once again as the best of demons.
Khara, accused by her earlier and admired again, said to Dusana, chief of army:
There are fourteen thousand demons at my command ready to act according to my will. They are warriors of terrific speed and will not retreat from the fight.
They are of the colour of the dark blue cloud, dreadful and merciless, strong and powerful fighters who roam about forturing people.
O handsome one, get them all, powerful like tigers, demons with large countenances, mighty and arragant, ready (for the fight).
O goodnatured one, get my chariot, bows and arrows, wonderful swords of different kinds and sharp missiles ready quickly.
O expert in warfare, I wish to lead those great warriors of Paulasthya family, to kill that immodest Rama.
While Khara was speaking thus, Dusana reported that a huge chariot of the colour of the Sun yoked with good horses of variegated hues stood ready.
Then the impatient Khara mounted the chariot that looked like the peak of mount Meru. It was decorated with pure gold, had golden wheels, poles studded with vaidurya. The carriage of the chariot was engraved with golden figures of fishes, flowers, trees, the Sun, stars, flocks of auspicious birds, flags and swords. Shining with small bells, it was yoked to fine horses.
The demons of terrific prowess surounded Khara and Dusana and stood by, when they saw both of them mounting the chariot.
Khara mounted the chariot, saw the demons holding great weapons, wearing dreadful shields and holding flags, and ordered them to march.
Then the army of the demons wearing dreadful shields, holding weapons and flags, and making a loud noise started in great speed from Janasthanam.
The fourteen thousand demons loyal to the wishes of Khara, took in their hands, maces, piercing weapons, spears, sharp axes used in battle, swords, wheels, splinters, iron clubs, powerful missiles, dreadful iron bars of giant size, bows made of bamboo, clubs and frightening weapons like thunderbolt (of Indra) and  departed from Janasthana.
Khara's chariot moved a bit behind the army of demons of frightening prowess who rushed forward to attack (Rama).
Knowing the mind of Khara, the charioteer hastened the horses of the colourful  chariot decorated with pure gold.
Spurred by the charioteer, the chariot of Khara, the slayer of enemies, produced a rattle that filled all four quarters and the intermediate directions.
Khara in extreme anger hastened, like Yama, to slay his enemy. He roared loudly like a cloud raining hail stones and impelled his charioteer to speed up. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वालल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वाविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
As the army marched from there (Janasthana) a huge dark cloud of the colour of an ass rained dreadful inauspicious water, red as blood.
The swift horses yoked to the chariot stumbled casually while galloping on the plane highway sprinkled with flowers.
A dark ring, bloodred in colour appeared on the border of the Sun's orb, dark in the middle. This phenomenon of the Sun appeared like a ring of moving charcoal covering the Sun.
A huge vulture, frightening to look at flew up and sat on top of the flag on the staff of gold.
Flesheating beasts and birds flocked at Janasthana producing a cacophony.
The dreadful jackals making ghastly howls turning towards the illuminated direction and produced frightening sounds indicating inauspicious time for the demons.
The clouds looked like shattered mountains pouring down bloodlike rain which filled the sky and made it appear frighteningly different.
A terrific darkness, spread all over, produced frightening horripilation. Even the four quarters and the intermediary zones were not discernible.
Even before Sunset the twilight looked like a fresh wound. Then wild animals, birds, kankas, jackals and vultures facing towards Khara screeched, indicating danger.
Bad omens that always bring inauspiciousness were a dreadful evidence of what is going to happen. Jackals howled, facing Khara's army with their mouths emitting fire.
The planet Ketu appeared  like an iron beam near the Sun. Although it was not the fullmoon or newmoon day, Rahu eclipsed the Sun. Wind blew hard and the Sun was lustreless.
The stars rose in the sky and glittered like fireflies even before night arrived. The fishes and the aquatic birds in the lotusponds hid themselves under water.  Lotuses dried up in tanks and the trees stood bereft of flowers and fruits.
Although there was no wind, dust rose like a brown cloud and the sarika birds sang (vichi kuchi) thoughtlessly.
Dreadful to watch were the thunderstorms and the meteors that dropped down from the sky. The earth trembled all over with mountains, groves and forests.
While the intelligent and courageous Khara was seated on the chariot and shouting, his left shoulder shook violently and throat throttled.
While watching all this, his eyes brimmed with tears. His forehead ached. Yet he was too deluded to beat a retreat.
Looking at these dreadful, horripilating occurrences Khara laughed and said to the demons:
Valiant and strong, I do not take seriously these terrifying omens boding calamity  just as a strong man does not care for the weak.
With my sharp arrows I can even bring down the stars from the sky. If angered, I can cause mortality to the god of death.
I do not wish to return, without killing with my sharp arrows that Rama who is proud of his strength and his brother Lakshmana.
Let my sister be satisfied by drinking the blood of both Rama and Lakshmana on whose account this adversity has come.
I have never faced defeat in wars, and all of you have seen it with your eyes. I am not telling you a lie.
When angry, I can kill even (Indra) the wielder of the thunderbolt, rider of the intoxicated Airavata and lord of the gods. What to speak of these two petty humans?
Fallen into the deathtrap, the great army of the demon, felt very happy on hearing Khara roaring.
Great souls like sages, gods, gandharvas, and siddhas including celestial bards assembled to see the battle.
Holy men assembled and uttered benedictions, saying, 'let there be wellbeing for the cows and brahmins associated with men of pious deeds in all the (three) worlds.
'Let Rama conquer the descendants of Paulasthya in the war like Visnu, the wielder of the wheel had defeated great demons'.
The great ascetics were talking thus and more. The gods waiting eagerly on heavenly chariots saw the army of the demons whose life span was shortened (who were doomed to death).
Seeing Khara, their chief on the chariot driving fast, the army of demons too marched forward.
Surrounded by twelve valiant warriors like Syenagami, Pruthugreeva, Yagnasatru, Vihangama, Durjaya, Karaviraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghmali, Mahamali, Sarpasya and Rudhirasana, Khara proceeded.
Similarly Dusana proceeded with four  Mahakapali, Sthulaksha, Pramathi and Trisira  around him.
The mighty, swiftfooted army of valiant demons surrounded the princes (Rama and Lakshmana) all on a sudden like the planets around the Sun and the Moon.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयोविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Khara endowed with malicious might was marching towards the hermitage, Rama and his brother saw the same omens of impending calamity the demon had seen.
When Rama saw the most dreadful, horripilating phenomena foreboding calamity, he said to Lakshmana:
O longarmed Lakshmana see these calamitous phenomena that forebode mass destruction of men and demons.
These rumbling clouds, brownishred like the colour of a donkey,  are moving about in the sky showering streams of blood.
O Lakshmana all my arrows are smoking and this goldplated bow welcomes me to war.
The way the forestbirds are screeching makes me foresee danger and makes survival doubtful.
A mass destruction of life is going to take place. There is no doubt about it. O brave Lakshmana my right shoulder trembles again and again, indicating the defeat of the enemy. Your beaming visage presages victory.
O Lakshmana, while preparing for war, those whose faces look pale are, for sure, going to die.
A dreadful roar of demons and the loud sound of wardrums beaten by the wicked demons are heard.
A wise man who apprehends danger or one who desires his own good should plan his defence even before the onset of danger.
Therefore, take shelter along with Sita in the inaccessible mountain cave, overgrown with trees, ready with your bow and arrows.
O dear, I do not like you to oppose this word of honour. You must touch my feet and go without delay.
You are valiant and strong. There is no doubt that you can kill all these demons. But I desire to kill them.
Thus ordered by Rama, Lakshmana took the arrows and the bow and accompanied by Sita took shelter in the inaccessible cave.
With Lakshmana and Sita inside the cave, Rama heaved his shield, saying, Oh the work is accomplished.
Adorned with the shield, Rama shone like smokeless fire rising in darkness.
Valiant Rama lifted the huge bow and arrows and stood there, filling the directions with the twangs of his bow.
Then the gods along with gandharvas, siddhas, and celestial bards assembled there, wishing to witness the war.
Great ascetics of the world, distinguished brahmarsis, accomplishers of pious deeds assembled and said to one another:
'Let there be wellbeing for the cows, brahmins, and all the worlds. Let Rama, the scion of the Raghu race, conquer the Paulastyas (demons) in war like lord Visnu, wielder of the disc, who defeated the most powerful demons'.
Thus looking at one another they discussed among themselves how there can be war between the righteous Rama fighting singlehanded on the one hand and the fourteen thousand demons, performers of terrific deeds, on the other.
Rajarsis, siddhas, great brahmins with their clan and gods on the celestial chariots waited to see the war whetted with curiosity.
Seeing Rama standing on the war front, engrossed and radiating heroic lustre, all beings were alarmed.
Rama, who is unwearied in action and who is of an incomparable (lovely) form, looked ferocious like the wielder of Pinaka (Lord Siva).
Then appeared on all sides the wellequipped army of demons raising deep sounds with dreadful shields, weapons and banners.
The forest was filled with tumultuous sounds of the warriors roaring like lions,  shouting at one another, stretching the bowstrings constantly, yawning, proclaiming loudly and beating the drums.
The ferocious animals of the forest got frightened and ran away to silent spots without looking back.
The fierce army, deep like the sea, equipped with various missiles approached Rama.
Rama, wellversed in warfare, cast his eyes on all sides to see the army of Khara that had come prepared for war.
Rama stretched the formidable bow and lifted the arrows from his quiver to kill the demons and assumed intense anger.
Rama stood burning in anger like the fire of the doom's day. It was difficult even to look at him. Seeing him full of glow even the sylvan deities ran away.
Rama in anger looked like Lord Siva ready to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha.
Seeing Rama flashing (in anger) and standing on the warfront all creatures ran away frightened.
The army of demons equipped with blazing armour, bows and banners appeared like a mass of blue clouds at Sunrise. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुर्विंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Khara accompanied by his pilot party arrived at the hermitage of Rama, the destroyer of enemies and saw him in fury, standing ready with his bow.
On seeing Rama, Khara held his terribly twanging bow and arrow, stood facing him, and ordered the charioteer to drive towards him.
Commanded by Khara, the charioteer also urged the horses towards the mightyarmed Rama standing alone and wielding the bow.
Seeing Khara attacking (Rama) all the demon ministers surrounded him  roaring.
Seated on a chariot in the midst of the demons, Khara looked like the rising Mars in the middle of the stars.
Khara struck Rama of immeasurable prowess with a thousand arrows and roared loudly.
Thereafter all the infuriated demons showered on invincible Rama, wielder of a fierce bow, many kinds of weapons.
Overtaken by anger, the demons continuously hurled at Rama hammers, spears, spikes, barbed missiles, swords and battleaxes.
Very powerful demons like huge clouds roared, eager to kill Rama in war. They ran forward on chariots, horses and tall elephants, looking like  mountain tops.
The battalions of demons sent down streams of arrows on Rama just like clouds  downpour on mountains.
Surrounded by the terrible demons Rama appeared like Lord Siva at dusk with hosts of his retinues arounds.
Rama resisted the weapons released by the demons like the sea, the inflow of river waters.
Rama remained unhurt like a great mountain struck by many glowing thunderbolts. He felt no pain even though his limbs were hit by the dreadful weapons.
Wounded all over the body, bleeding through the wounds caused by weapons, Rama looked like the evening Sun covered with clouds.
Seeing Rama left alone surrounded by many thousands of demons, the gods, ghandarvas and siddhas became very sad.
Thereafter Rama, mighty angry, bent his bow and released hundreds and thousands of unfeathered arrows.
As if sporting, Rama discharged the arrows attached with herons' feathers. The arrows were inescapable, unbearable like that of Yama's staff, that went straight without missing the target.
The arrows like the noose of the god of death released by Rama on the enemy army easily destroyed the lives of the demons.
Rama's arrows pierced the bodies of the demons and drenched in blood, they, looking like burning fire, shone in the sky.
From Rama's bow bent into a cirle, countless fierce arrows able to take the lives of demons were released.
In war Rama cut asunder the bows, flag tops, armour and heads of demons, their shoulders and thighs that were like the trunks of elephants, in their hundreds and thousands.
He killed horses with golden armours yoked to the chariots along with charioteers, elephants along with riders, the cavalry along with their horses and infantry and sent them all to the abode of death.
The bodies of the demons torn into pieces by the very sharp iron arrows and by the arrows called vikarni, they cried and shouted aloud in pitiable voices.
Just like the dried up forest burnt by the fire, the army was totally destroyed by Rama's arrows that pierced into the vital parts of the soldiers.
A few warriors of fierce strength approached Rama and hurled at him very powerful weapons, spears, swords and axes.
Strongarmed Rama attacked them with his arrows and cut off their heads and took their lives.
The heads, armour and bows fell down broken on the ground like trees in the wind gererated by Garuda's wings.
The rest of the demons hit by the arrows ran desperate towards Khara for refuge.
Pacifying them all, Dusana regathered them again and ran towards Rama like an angry Yama rushing towards Rudra.
Under Dusana's protection, all of them felt relieved from fear and, carrying sal and palm trees and stones as weapons, advanced towards Rama again.
Holding spears, hammers and bows in their hands, the mighty demons rained on Rama weapons like arrows, trees and stones.
The thrilling, fierce, horrifying and horripilating battle again ensued betwen Rama and the demons.
As the infuriated demons again hurtled towards Rama, filling the quarters and the intermediate directions and raining missiles, Rama aimed at them dazzling gandharvastras, producing a frightening warcry.
Rama then let out from his bow, stretched round, thousands of arrows that covered all the ten quarters.
The demons, though wounded, could not see whereform the terrible arrows came. They only saw Rama shooting the arrows.
Through the darkness created by the arrows that covered the sky and the Sun, Rama looked as though he was vomitting them.
It seemed as if it all happened at the same time, the entire earth filling with demons seriously injured, slain and fallen down on the ground.
There were bodies of demons pierced and torn, thinned and fallen down, destroyed, broken and cut into pieces scattered in their thousands.
Slain thus by Rama's arrows, the ground was littered with (bodies of) demons with limbs dismembered, headdresses and shoulders cut off, arms, thighs and knees decked with various ornaments amputated, chariots, horses, best of elephants, fans made of the tail of chamari deer (used as an insignia of royalty), umbrellas, several  flags, and weapons like spears, swords, darts, battleaxes and stones crushed into pieces and arrows splintered and scattered all over. The ground looked frightening.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Mightyarmed Dusana saw  the army  getting killed in war. He led the forces of five thousand demons, dreadfuly quick at fighting, dangeous to face and who will not beat a retreat.
The demons continuously hurled at him (Rama)  spears and swords and rained stones, trees and arrows from all sides
Righteous Rama, retaliated with his sharp arrows such as the rain of trees and stones, the mighty destroyers of life.
Rama retaliated in great anger to kill without caring for the shower of weapons like a bull with its eyes closed.
Overpowered by anger, Rama, with a blazing glow, covered Dusana and his army with his arrows.
Thereafter Dusana, chief of the army, angrily released at Rama equally powerful arrows comparable to thunderbolt.
Heroic Rama, mighty angry, then, broke the big bow of  Dusana, with his swordlike arrow. And with a series of four arrows cut his four horses to pieces.
After killing the horses with sharp arrows Rama severed the charioteer's head with an arrow of the shape of the crescent moon and pierced Dusana's chest with a set of three arrows.
With his bow and chariot broken, charioteer and horses killed,  Dusana took up a spear in his hand that appeared like a huge mountain top. Bound by golden bands, covered the iron nails, wetted with the enemy's marrow it created a horripilation. It appeared as though it  could crush the army of gods and render the enemy powerless. It carried the killing touch of the thunderbolt and could break open the enemy's fort.
With the spear that looked like a mighty serpent, Dusana, the cruel demon, advanced towards Rama.
Seeing Dusana going to pounce upon him, Rama cut off with two arrows both his arms adorned with armlets.
With the hands amputated, his huge spear, like the banner of Indra, slipped off his hands and fell down on the ground on the battle front.
Dusana fell down on the ground with broken hands like a proud elephant with both his tusks shattered.
Seeing Dusaana collapse dead on the ground, all beings hailed Rama, saying, 'Well done, well done'.
Meanwhile all the three army chiefs, Mahakapala, Sthulaksha, and the mighty Pramathi ran towards Rama in anger, bound (as though) by the noose of death.
Mahakapala had a huge spear, Sthulaksha, a sharpedged spear and Pramathi, a battleaxe.
On seeing them rushing to attack him with sharp weapons, Rama received them quickly with pointed arrows as though they were guests.
Mahakapala's head was cut to pieces with sharp arrows and Pramathi was killed with a countless series  of arrows. Pramathi's body, like a huge tree with many branches collapsed on the ground.
Rama filled the eyes of Sthulaksha with sharp arrows, and in anger shot five thousand arrows at the five thousand followers of Dusana in a moment and sent them to the abode of Yama.
Seeing Dusana and his followers killed, enraged Khara commanded his extremely strong army chiefs this way:
Dusana and his followers are killed in the battle. You, all the demons, along with your great army and different kinds of weapons should kill that wicked human being, Rama.
Having spoken thus, angry Khara ran towards Rama. Syenagami, Pruthugriva, Yajnasatru, Vihanga, Durjaya, Karaveeraksha, Parusha, Kalakarmuka, Meghamali, Mahamali, Sarpasya, Rudhirasanaall these twelve valiant army chiefs along with their forces rushed towards Rama, releasing the sharpest arrows at him.
Powerful Rama thereafter slayed the remaining army with his weapons studded with gold and diamonds and glowing like fire.
The goldtipped arrows which resembled fire covered with smoke shattered the army of demons like huge trees knocked down by thunder.
Rama killed a hundred demons  with one hundred arrows by a single stroke. The same way he killed a thousand of them with a thousand arrows on the battle front.
The demons fell down on the ground with their shields  and ornaments broken, their  bows stained with blood splintered.
The entire ground was littered with bodies of demons fallen in the battle with loose hair and with drops of blood on them looking like a great sacrificial altar strewn all over with kusa grass.
With the slaughtered bodies of demons lying on the ground, the forest in a moment looked very dreadful like hell with the mud of soil soaked with flesh and blood.
Fourteen thousand formidable demons were killed by Rama, a pedestrian human,  singlehanded.
Of that entire army great warrior Khara,Trisira and Rama, destroyer of foes alone remained.
The rest of the mighty, dreadful, intolerable demons were killed on the war front by Rama, elder brother to Lakshmana.
Thereafter seeing the formidable army killed by mighty Rama, Khara lifted a thunderbolt like Indra, and advanced towards Rama in a great chariot.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वालमिकिय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षङ्विंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentysixth sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
As Khara advanced towards Rama, Trisira the chief of the army approached him and said these words:
O valiant one assign this work to me. Refrain from this audacity. See how I am going to put down the mightyarmed Rama in the battle.
I promise you on my weapon that I will kill Rama.He who killed all demons deserves to be slain.
Restrain yourself for a moment from the enthusiasm to fight the war. Please act as an arbitrator and see who is killing whom.
If Rama is killed be happy and go to Janasthana or else if I am killed you can fight.
When Khara was prevailed upon by Trisara in that manner with a wish to face death, Khara  permitted him  by saying 'You may go and fight'.Accordingly he advanced towards Rama.
Trisira who looked a mountain with three peaks also got horses harnessed to a shining chariot and to attack Rama proceeded.
Trisira unleashed a stream of arrows like a huge cloud (releasing rain). They produced sound, a drum drenched with water, creates.
On seeing demon Trisira advancing towards him, Rama shook sharp arrows off his bow.
The tumultuous combat between Rama and Trisira looked like the strong fight between a lion and an elephant.
Then Rama hit  with three arrows on the forehead by Trisira flew into a fury and said in a state of great excitement:
Oh see the strength of this undaunted demon whose arrows fell like flowers on my forehead and only left a scratch.
Receive the arrows released from my bowstring. Saying so, the angry and agitated Rama discharged fourteen arrows, venomous like a snake, on the chest of Trisira .
With four arrows having strong joints, the mighty hero (Rama) threw down his enemy's four swiftfooted horses.
Rama brought down the charioteer with eight arrows and with one tore down the lofty banner of the chariot to shreds.
Rama then hit the demon with arrows on his chest while he was running away from the broken chariot. The demon became numb.
The mighty Rama in fury dismembered the heads of that demon with three sharp and swift arrows.
The demon with his heads decapitated, hit by Rama's arrows a little while ago, fell down, vomitting blood.
Those surviving demons who were under the protection of Khara got scared and retreated fast and fled like deer frightened by a tiger.
Personally persuading the fleeing army to come back, the angry Khara leaped forward towards Rama just as Rahu approaches the moon.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Khara was overtaken by fear at the prowess of Rama, when he saw Dusana and Trisira killed.
Khara, the mighty demon, saw his large, irrepressible army killed. He saw Trisira and Dusana slain singlehanded by Rama. Nervous, he advanced towards Rama wage war just as Namuchi approached Indra.
Khara drew his strong bowstring in anger and released the bloodhungry arrows, which appeared like venomous snakes.
Khara, sat on the chariot, and with a twang of his bowstring released arrows in all directions, exhibiting his skill in the use of weapons.
When Rama, the great warrior, saw Khara approaching him, he fixed powerful arrows  on his bow and covered all directions and intermediate quarters with his arrows.
He rained sparkling arrows which were irresistible. He filled the sky with arrows just as the raingod fills it with rain without leaving any space.
The arrows released by Khara and Rama on one another filled the entire sky. Everywhere only arrows and no sky could be seen.
While they were engaged in the battle, eager to kill each other the sky was covered with arrow and the Sun could not be seen.
Then Khara shot Rama with Nalika darts and darts called Vikarni like goads hit a mighty elephant.
Demon Khara positioned on the chariot, bow in hand, appeared to all beings like Yama, god of death holding the noose.
Khara thought valiant Rama who had destroyed his whole army might be exhausted by now.
When Rama saw Khara aggressively advancing like a lion to attack him, he was not perturbed, for he knew he was a fawn before a lion (which Rama was).
Then Khara mounting a great chariot which was glowing like the Sun, advanced towards Rama just as an insect hurtles towards fire.
Exhibiting his agility of the hand, Khara shattered the bow and the arrow in the grip of Rama ,the  great soul.
The influriated Khara this time took up seven arrows blazing like Indra's thunderbolt  and hit his armour.
The armour of Rama who looked radiant like the Sun fell on the ground, struck by the welljointed darts released by Khara.
Khara then attacked Rama of unequal strength in fight, with a thousand darts  and roared loudly.
Rama, scion of the Raghu race, afflicted by the darts in all parts of the body, glowed in his anger like smokeless fire burning.
Then Rama, destroyer of foes, strung another great bow of fearful sound in order to put an end to the enemy.
Thereafter Rama advanced, aiming at Khara the superior Vaishnava bow given by sage Agastya.
Rama took up in a rage the welljointed, smooth darts with golden feathers and broke the flag post of the chariot of Khara to pieces.
The beautiful, golden flag post, broken into several pieces, fell down on earth.It appeared as if the Sun had come down to earth at the behest of the gods.
Quite enraged, Khara who knew how to hit the tender parts (of the body) in an encounter sent out four arrows on Rama. It was like poking an elephant's limbs with a javelin.
Rama, hit by the arrows released from the bow of Khara, all his limbs drenched in blood, became very furious.
The best among archers and a supreme shooter, he lifted the bow, fixed his target and released six arrows in the great fight.
Rama hit one arrow on the head, two on the shoulders and three of the shape of the crescent moon on the chest (of the enemy).
Enraged and effulgent Rama took up thirteen darts, radiant like the Sun, with a wish to kill the demon.
Rama, like Indra, strong and mighty, broke the yoke of Khara's chariot with one arrow, the four horses with four arrows, and with the sixth the charioteer's head, with three others the main pole of the chariot, with two the axle of the chariot, and with the twelfth Khara's bow and arrows were splintered. As if laughing at him, he pierced Khara's body with the thirteenth arrow.
Then, with bow broken, chariot destroyed, horses and charioteer dead, Khara jumped  down the chariot and stood on the ground holding a mace.
Then the gods, along with great sages came down in aerial chariots and assembled there. Delighted, they adored Rama, the great warrior, with folded hands for the work done.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकिय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टाविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyeigth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Effulgent Rama looked at Khara who stood with a mace in hand minus his chariot  and said to him first in a gentle voice and then harshly :
Although you command a huge army with many elephants, horses, chariots, etc.  you have done such cruel deeds that the entire world despises you.
One who  is wicked, does sinful deeds and causes distress to all beings, will not survive even if he is the lord of the three worlds.
O nightranger, one who does a horrific deed which is against the world will be killed like an evil serpent come near.
Whoever commits sinful deeds out of greed or passion and without realisation will be ruined at the end like a lizard that eats hailstone (and dies).
O demon  what benefit will you  get by killing the venerable ascetics, followers of righteous path residing in Dandaka forest?
Cruel people, who are despised by the world for their sinful deeds, will not  be prosperous for long just like trees with decayed roots.
Just as the trees bear flowers at the proper season, so also people will certainly reap the fruits of their terrible, sinful deeds at appropriate time.
O nightranger  people will reap the result of their sinful actions in this world soon like one eating poisonous food.
O nightranger  I have come with the orders of the king to put an end to the lives of the perpetrators of dreadful, sinful and offensive deeds in this world.
Now when I unleash the golden  arrows, they will pierce through your body and come out like serpents emerging from the anthill.
Slain by me in the battle today, you and your army will follow the righteous men eaten by you in Dandaka forest.
The great seers whom you have earlier tortured and killed will, from their aerial vehicles, see you fallen into hell.
O vile fellow, now you may strike at me as you please. I will make your head fall  down like a palm fruit.
Challenged by Rama  in that manner, Khara, his senses switched off, eyes turned red due to anger, replied laughing :
O son of Dasaratha, it is not praiseworthy to kill ordinary demons in war. Why do you praise yourself for it?
The valiant, strong and the best of men do not at all speak proudly of themselves  and their valour.
O Rama common people, having no control over themselves and the lowest of kshatriyas boast of themselves in the world in a meaningless way as you are doing (now).
When death comes in a battle no hero will name his race and boast of himself unnessarily.
All your meanness is exhibited by your boasting just as the kusa grass caught by fire appears like gold.
Indeed, (it is strange that) you do not see me holding a mace and standing here like an unshakeable mountain which contains minerals and supports the earth.
Just like lord Yama, holding a noose of death is alone enough to destroy the three worlds, I am alone sufficient to take away your life in war, a mace in hand.
Indeed, I shall not speak any more even though a lot can be said on you. But the Sun is about to set and it will be improper to wage war thereafter.
You have killed these fourteen thousand demons. Therefore, I will wipe their tears by destroying you.
Having said this, highly enraged Khara adorned with large shoulder bands, hurled  at Rama, his mace glowing like a thunderbolt.
The huge, blazing mace hurled by Khara's arms reduced the trees and shrubs into ashes and came close to Rama.
The mace, which moved in the sky burning like the noose of death was shattered to pieces by Rama.
The mace shattered by the arrows of Rama , fell down scattered to pieces on the ground like a female serpent subdued by the force of mantras and medicine.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, fond of dharma, broke into pieces Khara's mace with his arrows, and smiling at bewildered Khara, said:
O lowly demon, you have already exhibited all your strength. Inferior to me in energy, you are needlessly roaring.
The mace about which you boasted so much has betrayed your confidence. Shattered by my arrows it now lies on the ground.
You said you will wipe the tears of the dead demons. (Now) those words have proved false.
You are mean. You have false pride. You are of low behaviour. I shall take away your life, O demon,, Just as Garuda carried off the nectar.
Now with your throat split open by my arrows , the earth will drink your foamy blood full of bubbles.
With all your limbs covered with dust, both the arms dropped down and stretched  out  on the ground, you will sleep as though hugging the earth, like embracing a rare woman.
When you, O vile demon, will go into eternal sleep the Dandaka grounds will provide shelter to those who deserve it here.
O demon, when my arrows destroy your hold over Janasthana the sages will move freely without fear all over this forest.
Having lost all their relations, the demonesses, who were causing fear to others,will move away with faces full of tears.
Your wives, who have got a husband like you, must have been born to a befitting race. They will taste the pangs of sorrow today, for no reasons whatsoever.
O cruel, mean, vile fellow, you had been always opposing the brahmins who pour oblations in fire under fear.
When Rama was thus speaking in a state of excitement in the middle of war, the choleric Khara  started abusing him in a harsher tone.
You are very haughty. When there is every cause of fear you pretend fearlessness. Being in the grip of death you do not know what to speak and what not to speak.
Those bound by the noose of death, do not know what to and what not to do, as their six senses cease to function.
Having said thus to Rama with a frown on his face, Khara, looking around for something to strike him with, saw a huge sal tree not very far.
Khara, biting his lower lip, uprooted the tree , lifted it with his mighty arms, and shouting at Rama loudly hurled it at him, saying, 'You are dead'.
Brave Rama shattered with a flood of arrows the tree falling over him and summoned sharp anger to end Khara in war.
Full of sweat and with the corners of his eyes turned red, Rama hit Khara with a thousand arrows in the encounter.
With his body pierced with arrows his blood started flowing like the waterfalls flow from mount Prasravana.
Completely struck by Rama's arrows, Khara, intoxicated with the smell of  blood, ran speedily charging towards Rama.
Rama who was an adept in the science of arms picked up his valour quickly and moved a step back (not  to give him an opportunity to strike), looking at the highly agitated Khara falling upon him, with his body fully drenched in blood.
Rama took a dart glowing like fire which resembled another Brahmadanda to kill Khara in the war.
Righteous Rama placed on his bow the dart given him by wise Indra, king of the gods, and shot it at Khara.
Bending the bow fully, Rama released the arrow roaring like a violent gust of wind, which fell on Khara's chest.
Just as Yama was burnt by Rudra's fire(from his eyes) in Swetaranya, Khara collapsed on the ground consumed by the fire of Rama's arrow.
Khara fell down just like Vrutra or Bala killed by Indra's thunderbolt or like Numuchi by the froth of the sea.
Then the rajarsis, great seers gathered together, offered their worship to Rama  and said these words joyfully :
For this purpose, killer of Paka, the gIorious Indra (who can break a fortress), came to the hermitage of Sarabhanga.
You are brought to this place by the great sages who had cleverly devised a plan to kill the cruel sinners, these demons৷৷
O son of Dasaratha, you have accomplished such a task that hereafter the sages in Dandaka will discharge their rightful duties happily.
Meanwhile the wonderstruck gods along with the charanas (celestial bards) got together and began beating the drums and raining showers of flowers on Rama from all sides.
'In a little more than half a moment of this great war Rama had accomplished the terrific task of killing with sharp darts fourteen thousand demons, led by Khara and Dusana.
'Rama who knows the self has performed a great work. Oh what prowess what efficiency  only lord Visnu could do this'. So saying all the gods went back to their respective destinations.
In the mean time, heroic Lakshmana accompanied by Sita came out of the mountain cave happily and entered the hermitage.
Then victorious Rama having been worshipped by the seers and also by Lakshmana entered the hermitage.
On seeing Rama killing the enemies of the great sages for their happiness Sita felt glad and embraced her husband.
Sita, daughter of Janaka, was happy to see the demons killed by Rama who himself was unhurt.
Then the daughter of Janaka, cheerful Sita, who had a face bright like the moon, embraced Rama, destroyer of demons who was worshipped by the delighted sages. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Quickly did Akampana leave Janasthana, and quickly he entered Lanka. He said to Ravana:
O king many demons dwelling at Janasthana including Khara have been killed. I manged to escape with much difficulty.
When Akampana thus reported to the tenheaded Ravana, his eyes reddened with anger. He spoke to Akampana as if he was burning him with his eyes :
He who has destroyed my beautiful Janasthana is sure to die. His life is under the control of others (his enemies). Where can he be(alive) in all the worlds?
One who has caused displeasure to me cannot be happy, be it Indra or Kubera, or Yama or even Visnu.
I am the destroyer of the destroyer (Yama). I can burn even that which burns (fire). I can infuse Death with the characteristics of death itself.
If angry, I can burn the Sun and even fire with my radiance. I can arrest  the speed of the wind instantly with my effort.
Akampana, out of fear, implored the inflamed Ravana with folded hands and faltering voice to spare him.
The tenheaded Ravana, lord of the demons, assured safety to Akampana, who  gratefully said these words without hesitation:
Dasaratha has  a young son,  by name, Rama. He has a body like a lion's. He has strong, round arms and his shoulders resemble those of a bull.
He is a hero of great fame and unequal prowess. He has destroyed your Janasthana and also Khara along with Dusana.
Having heard Akampana's words, Ravana, the lord of demons, sighed heavily like the king of serpents and said these words:
Did Rama come to Janasthana with Indra and the gods ? O Akampana   speak.
Hearing Ravana's words, Akampana continued telling about great Rama's strength and his exploits in war.
Rama is his name. He looks very radiant. He is the best among the archers. Owner of divine weapons, he is comparable to Indra in war.
He is strong with bright red eyes. He has a deep voice with the resonance of a drum. His face is like the moon. Lakshmana, his younger brother, is similar to him in appearance.
Rama is prosperous. He is the best among kings. Lakshmana with him is like wind with fire. Rama has pulled down Janasthana.
Indeed, they are great men. No god came there (to lend him a hand). There is no need to investigate further about it.  The goldenfeathered arrows released by Rama turned into fivehooded serpents and consumed the demons.
Wherever the demons went they, gripped by fear, only saw Rama in front. O sinless sire In this manner your Janasthana was destroyed by him.
Hearing Akampana's words, Ravana said, I will go to Janasthana and kill Rama along with Lakshmana.
Thus said by Ravana, Akampana responded, I will tell you what happened there. O king   listen to the strength and valour of Rama.
Rama is of great fame. When outraged, he is irrepressible. He can arrest with his arrows even the speed of a river (in spate).
Powerful Rama can pull down the sky along with the planets and stars. He can lift the drowning earth from the depth of the sea.
He is so very powerful that he can drown the earth by breaking the boundary of the sea. He can arrest the speed of the sea or of the wind with his arrows.
He is a tiger among men. He is so powerful that he can destroy the world and recreate the creatures once again by his valour.
O tenheaded one, just as it is not possible for sinners to attain heaven it is not possible for you or for the entire world of demons to win him in war
I do not think it is possible for gods and demons together to kill him, yet there is a way for his destruction. You may listen to me with single mindedattention:
Rama has a wife in this world, by name, Sita, who is beautiful, has a slender waist and a wellformed body. Adorned with gems, she is a jewel among women,
She has no equal among goddesses nor among gandharvis nor apasaras nor among demonesses. How can there be a peer of her among human beings ?
Abduct Rama's wife by force in that great forest and bereft of Sita, he will give up his life.
Ravana, the strongarmed king of demons, relished the words of Akampana and pondering over the matter, said to him :
Yes, early in the morning I will go alone gladly with the charioteer and bring Vaidehi here to this great city.
Having said so, Ravana got on a chariot yoked with donkeys. It had the colour of the Sun. It illuminated all directions. Ravana left.
The great chariot of the demon king (Ravana) flying in the sky shone like the Moon in the cloud.
Ravana reached the hermitage of Maricha and met him who was the son of Tataka. The demon king was treated with food that can be chewed and food that can be eaten.
Maricha personally offered Ravana a seat. He offered him water and paid him obeisance. Making meaningful enquiries he said in appropriate words :
O lord of demons  O king hope every one is fine in the world of demons. O lord, (though) your sudden arrival puts me in doubt (about everything going right).
Having thus been asked by Maricha, glorious Ravana, who was eloquent in speech, spoke to him :
O dear, Rama who is capable of doing difficult deeds has killed my sentinels. The indestructible Janasthana has been routed in war. Could you help me in abudcting his wife ? (That is the only way to bring him to his knees).
Having heard Ravana ,the king of demons, Maricha said these words:  O king, who is that enemy of yours who, in the guise of a friend,  has told you about Sita? Though obliged by you, who is he that is not happy with you, O tiger among demons?
Tell me who asked you to bring Sita ? Who wishes to demolish the peak of the entire clan of demons ?
He who has encouraged you in this is your enemy, indeed. He wants you to pluck out the fangs from the serpent's mouth.
By  whose action have you been led into this wrong direction? Who has hit you on your forehead while you were sleeping comfortably?
Rama is like a mighty tusker. His pure and high birth is his trunk. His wellbuilt and strong arms are his tusks. His brilliance in his ichor. Nobody can face this intoxicated elephant in battle.
Rama is a lion in the form of man, a lion on warfront with its tail touching the waist when angry. This lion is deft in killing deer in the form of clever demons. His body is full of arrows. The sharp swords are his pointed teeth. It does not behove you to rouse such a lion who is asleep.
O king of demons  it is not proper (for you) to jump into the extremely fierce mouth of the nether world known as Rama. Who can steal the bow from his mighty arms which are whirlpools of mud. His arrows are rows of waves in the flow of the great war.
O lord of Lanka, chief of the demons, be pleased to return to Lanka and enjoy yourself in  the company of your wives. Let Rama enjoy with his wife in the forest.
Thus advised by Maricha ,the ten headed Ravana returned and entered his best of homes in the city of Lanka .इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Seeing Dusana, Khara and also Trisira along with the fourteen thousand demon warriors of terrific performance killed by Rama, singlehanded, Surpanakha roared     like a cloud.
Seeing the performance of Rama which is very difficult for others, Surpanakha got scared and went to Lanka, ruled by Ravana.
Surpanakha saw Ravana shining brilliantly, seated like Indra along with ministers and Maruts on top of the aerial chariot.
Ravana, sitting on the magnificent golden seat on a golden altar looked radiant like the Sun or the blazing fire.
Invincible to gods, gandharvas, all living beings, great sages and seers, he was like Yama, lord of death with wide open jaws.
He had scars of wounds caused by the thunderbolt received in war between gods and demons, and marks of scars on his chest made by tips of the the tusks of elephant Airavata.
Valiant Ravana had an attractive appearance with beautiful dresses twenty arms,ten heads, a broad chest  and brilliant royal marks.
Wearing burnished golden earrings, he looked bright like the glittering vaidurya. And with his wellformed arms, white teeth and  wide mouth, he looked like a mountain.
He was hit by the wheel of Visnu for hundreds of times during great wars and beaten by other weapons.
Ravana whose body was not hurt by the weapons in war with gods, who could perturb even the imperturbable seas, was quick  in action.
(He was) one who could lift and throw great mountains, torment even gods, violate  dharma at the root, and cast an evil eye on the wives of others.
He who could employ all divine weapons, disrupt sacrifices, had gone to the city of Bhogavati, defeated Vasuki and abducted the dear wife of Takshaka.
Ravana went to mount Kailasa, conquered Kubera and took away forcibly his aerial chariot Pushpaka which can fly as per the rider's desire
Out of anger he destroyed all the gardens of gods like Chitraratha of Kubera full of lotusponds and Nandana, the pleasuregarden of Indra.
He was like the peak of a mountain. He could stop with his arms the great Moon and Sun from rising. He was a scorcher of enemies.
This steadfast Ravana who had in the past performed penance for ten thousand years in a dense forest offered his heads to the selfborn Brahma.
He was unafraid of death in the hands of gods or demons or gandharvas or pisachas or birds or snakes in war except humans.
The mighty Ravana  defiled the sacred Soma juice, worthy of oblations, extracted by Brahmins by chanting mantras in scrifices.
He disrupted sacrifices at the final stage. He killed brahmins. He was ruthless, harsh, and  merciless. He was involved in activities against human welfare.
That demoness , Surpanakha saw  her very strong,valiant brother Ravana who made all beings cry and created fear in all worlds
Resplendently attired, adorned with jewels, wearing beautiful gardlands, seated on a raised throne, he(Ravana) was like death to even the lord of death
On reaching Ravana, the lord of demons, the delight of the Paulastya dynasty, and the destroyer of enemies surrounded by ministers, the terrified, Surpanakha said these words:
Showing her body disfigured by great Lakshmana, Surpanakha, the fearless wanderer, overwhelmed with fear said these cruel words  to Ravana sitting with large, glittering eyes:इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्वात्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When the distressed, anguished Surpanakha met Ravana who makes the world weep, he was seated in the midst of his ministers. She addressed him these harsh words:
Intoxicated with the pleasures of passion, acting on your own, ungoaded and unguided, you do not understand the problems arising out of great fear, problems you ought to know.
Lustful and greedy, you are addicted to vulgar pleasures. People will not respect you like the fire on the crematorium.
A king who does not act at the right time will be ruined along with the kingdom and its works.
Just as elephants keep away from a muddy river, people will keep distance from the king who does not employ spies, does not give audience to his people and is not independent.
Kings who are not under their own control and cannot protect the country, do not attract the minds of the people like mountains inside sea water.
Having created enmity with selfrespecting persons like gods, gandharvas and demons, with a fickle mind and without spies how long can you continue as king ?
O demon  you are childish and foolish. You do not even know what ought to be known. How can you rule as a king?
The best among the victorious kings, who are not masters of their espionage, judicial system and their exchequer are equal to the laity.
Since kings can see things from a faroff place with the help of the spies they are called farsighted.
Since you have not engaged any spy you do not know when your own relatives were killed in Janasthana. I take you to be a fool surrounded by ordinary ministers.
One Rama alone killed all the fourteen thousand demons including Dusana and Khara, demons  capable of fierce exploits.
Rama, the effortless performer of formindable tasks, has assured safety to the sages. Peace and happiness was restored to Dandaka forest but Janasthana has been ravaged.
O Ravana, you are not aware of what  has happened to your own kingdom. You are avaricious, intoxicated, and under others' control. A great fear has been generated in your own kingdom.
All living beings stop seeking refuge under a king who is, not a generous giver, but intoxicated, harsh, arrogant and fraudulent. They do not run to him for protection in times of calamity.
A king who is extremely arrogant, who is not acceptable to good people, who is selfconceited and cholerictempered will be murdered even by his own people at the time of adversity.
A king who does not do what ought to be done, does not fear what ought to be feared, will surely be dislodged from the kingdom and live a wretched life like a blade of grass.
Even dried up logs, or clods of earth, or a handful of dust may have some value but not a king who is dethroned.
Like a piece of cloth that is worn and discarded, like garlands put on  and crushed, a king dislodged from the kingdom is worthless even if he is capable.
A king who is alert, omniscient, has control over his senses, has a sense of gratitude and one of righteous conduct continues to rule for a long time.
The king who keeps both his eyes shut but keeps the eye of justice open, one who is free from anger and remains ever alert, is worshipped by the people.
O Ravana you are evilminded. You  are devoid of all these good qualities. Your spies could not know that there had been a great massacre of your fellowdemons.
A king who accuses others, who is addicted to sensual pleasures, who lacks a sense of judgement of  place and time, a sense of discrimination between virtue and vice and the right wisdom will destroy himself and the kingdom in no time.
Ravana, king of demons, wealthy, arrogant and mighty, listened to Surpanakha and pondered over the mistakes she mentioned.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रयस्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Incensed at the harsh words Surpanakha used in the midst of ministers, Ravana said:
Who is Rama? What is his strength? How does he look? How valiant is he? For what purpose has he entered the impenetrable Dandaka forest?
With what weapons he has killed demons like Khara, Dusana and Trisira ?
Thus questioned by Ravana, the demoness, overcome by anger, began telling him about Rama faithfully:
Rama, Dasaratha's son, has long arms, large eyes. He is clad in deerskin and bark. He resembles Cupid.
His bow resembles Indra's, He is adorned with gold bands. Drawing the bow, he releases glittering arrows like highly poisonous snakes.
I could not see Rama in the dreadful war while he was pulling an arrow from the quiver, aiming the dart, and drawing the bowstring.
Just as Indra destroys the crop ready for harvest by raining hailstones, I have seen Rama killing the army with a shower of arrows.
Fighting alone on foot with his sharp arrows Rama killed within a span of one and a half muhurta, the fourteen thousand dreadful demons including Dusana and Khara.
Sages have been assured safety. Peace has been restored to Dandaka forest. As Rama, the great soul, who knows the self, hesitated to kill a woman, I was alone saved after this humiliation.
His brother called Lakshmana looks radiant. He is virtuous and courageous like him, valiant, devoted and loyal.
He is impatient, invincible, victorious, bold, intelligent and strong. He is even the right hand of Rama, his outer life.
Rama's beloved consort is a largeeyed lady. Her face is like the full moon. She is engaged in the wellbeing of her husband.
She is an illustrious lady. She is goodlooking with her long hair, wellshaped nose and things. She appears to be the presiding deity of the forest, another goddess of wealth (Laxmi).
She is Sita, princess of Videha, a virtuous lady of golden complexion, a beautiful lady of slender waist and heavy hips.
I had not seen such a beautiful woman earlier, among the gandharvas, or yakshas, or kinneras. I have not seen such a beauty among the humans on earth.
Whosoever gets Sita as his wife, whoever she embraces happily will wish to live longer than Indra, the breaker of fortresses in this world.
She is a woman of good conduct, of praiseworthy beauty. She is matchless in her beauty on earth. She will be a suitable wife for you and you, a suitable husband for her.
O mightyarmed one  I have been disfigured by cruel Lakshmana as I was attempting to bring that lady of broad thighs, pointed breasts, heavy hips and a beautiful face to make her your wife.
If you see her today, this lady with a face like the fullmoon, you will (instantaneously) fall a victim to the arrows of the god of love.
If you intend her to be your wife, raise your right foot now and proceed to win her over.
O lord of the demons, do a favour to your clan by  killing that cruel Rama dwelling in the hermitage.
Kill Rama, that great warrior along with Lakshmana with sharp arrows and enjoy the  company of Sita happily as you like, with her husband dead.
If you like what I have said, do accordingly without any hesitation, O Ravana, lord of the demons.
Assess your own strength, O Lord of the demons, before you forcefully abduct that delicate Sita who is charming in all respects and make her your wife.
On hearing about the death of the demons including Khara and Dusana who fell to the straight and swift arrows of Rama, you should decide your course of action.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुस्त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtytfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Then hearing the horripilating words of Surpanakha, Ravana took leave of the ministers and went thinking about the task ahead of him.
Deliberating on the task ahead, duly considering the pros and cons, demerits and merits, strength and weakness, of the issue and having firmly decided within himself, he left for the beautiful coachshed.
Ravana went covertly to the coachshed and to the charioteer to get a chariot harnessed.
Thus ordered, the smart charioteer got the chariot of his choice harnessed in an instant.
The younger brother of Kubera (Ravana), the prosperous lord of the demons ascended the chariot which could go where he desired. Embellished with gold, studded with gems, harnessed with demonfaced donkeys, the chariot rolled towards the ocean, rumbling like a cloud.
Ravana, enemy of the gods, slayer of towering sages, with white yaktail fans, and white parasols, shining like smooth vaidurya, wearing pure gold earrings, clad in attractive attire, ten necks with twenty strong hands, ten heads looking like ten mountain peaks, a cloud in the sky encircled by lightnings and accompanied by cranes, ascended the chariot that could go wherever he desired.
Valiant Ravana wentwatching the mountains full of thousands of trees bearing flowers and fruits on the shore of the sea.
(The area) surrounded on all sides with lotusladen ponds filled with cool, sacred water, sprawling hermitages with elevated altars.
The place covered with banana plants and coconut trees  as well as blossoming sal and tamala trees was looking extremely beautiful.
The place looked charming with nagas, garudas, gandharvas, kinneras in their thousands and with the descendants of ajas, vaikhanasas, valakhilyas and with those who drink the rays of Sun and Moon for survival, with  sages who were highly disciplined in the intake of food,  spiritually accomplished  and selfcontrolled hermits and charanas.
(The place was) full of apsaras  in their thousands and paragons of beauty adorned with divine ornaments and garlands, and experts in lovesports.
It was chosen by prosperous wives of gods as a reosrt. Hosts of gods and demons were wandering, there in the hope of tasting nectar.
(It was ) full of small floats, flocks of swans, kraunchas, sarasas cackling in the ponds, with great joy. It had stretches of vaidurya stones on the shore and shone with the radiance of the sea
Speeding along, the brother of Kubera (Ravana) saw palewhite, spacious aerial chariots on all sides controlled by those who had conquered the higher worlds by their penances. These chariots, decked with heavenly garlands, and ringing with divine music could fly where one desired. He saw gandharvas and apsaras as well.
He saw thousands of tree trunks with finesmelling resins and sandalwood trees.
(He saw) very fine aguru trees in the forest as well as pleasuregroves of takkola fruits, fragrant  trees of a fine variety and fragrant nutmegs.
(He saw) tamala flowers in bloom, pepper shrubs in clusters and hoards of pearls kept for drying on the shores.
He saw stretches of conches, heaps of corals and mounds of gold and silver too.
He went watching fascinating waterfalls, pleasing ponds, cities filled with wealth and grain, looking splendid with beautiful women and full of elephants, horses and chariots.
It was a veritable heaven with the plain land flooded with the backwaters of the sea and gentle breeze blowing.
He saw a banyan tree with its branches spread on all sides measuring a hundred yojanas, looking like a cloud and providing shelter to the sages.
In the past, the mighty Garuda brought an elephant and a huge tortoise and sat on a branch of this tree to feed on them.
Due to the weight of this best of birds, the mighty Garuda, the leafy branch at once broke down.
Gathered together under the great tree were great sages like vaikhanasas, mashas, marichipas, valakhilyas, ajas and dhumras.
Out of compassion for the (endangered) seers Garuda carried away that hundredyojanalong branch along with the elephant and the tortoise with great speed.
Righteous Garuda, the best among the birds, stood on one foot and ate the flesh (of elephant and tortoise) and  with the branch of the tree, destroyed the settlement of the demons. Over the destruction of the demons and deliverance of the great seers he felt immeasurable happiness.
Quite happy, his energy redoubled, wise Garuda made up his mind to obtain nectar.
Twisting and twirling the grills of the window, he broke open the room made of gems and quietly carried away the nectar from Indra's mansion.
Ravana, the younger brother of Kubera, beheld that banyan tree called Subhadram ,which was a favoured resort of the sages bearing the ensignia of Garuda.
Ravana crossed over to the other side of the sea, the lord of rivers, and beheld a hermitage in a beautiful, secluded, sacred  place in the middle of the forest.
There he saw a demon Maricha, by name, clad in dark deerskin and bark ,with matted hair and living on restricted food.
When king Ravana reached there, Maricha received him  in accordance with tradition  and made worshipful offering to the king, fulfilling all his superhuman desires.
Maricha extended his hospitality with appropriate food and water and said with meaningful words:
O king  O lord of the demons  hope all is well in Lanka. What brings you here again so soon ?
Thus addressed by Maricha, the effulgent, eloquent Ravana replied with these words:इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
O dear Maricha hear my words. I am distressed and you are my ultimate refuge.
You know that my brothers, Khara and Dusana, the strongarmed heroes, my sister Surpanakha and  the mighty cannibal Trisira, and many other heroic demons successful in hitting their targets are bonafide residents. They have been harassing the followers of righteous path (the sages) at my behest.
These fourteen thousand heroes, perpetrators of terrible deeds, skilled in hitting the targets had been acting according to the direction of Khara.
These mighty demons, living in Janasthana, eqipped with different kinds of weapons, supported and led by Khara, met Rama in an encounter.
With his wrath generated, Rama, without even speaking anything, used his bow and the arrows.
Being a human being who fought on foot, he killed fourteen thousand ferocious demons with his sharp arrows.
Khara, Dusana and Trisira were killed in war.The residents of Dandaka forest are rendered safe and fearless.
Rama, a victim of his father's anger, banished into the forest with his wife, a shortlived mortal and a calumny on the kshatriyas has killed the army of demons.
He is a man of bad conduct, harsh, sharptonged, stupid, miserly and a slave to his senses. He is immoral and unrighteous, one who is busy harming others.
With no enmity whatsoever, merely because he has strength, he cut off the nose and ears of my sister and mutilated her. His wife Sita  is like the daughter of heaven. I would like to abduct her with force from Janasthana for which you should be my accomplice.
You are mighty. I do not care to fight even the gods when you and my brothers are by my side. Therefore, O demon, be my accomplice. (I know) you are capable of that.
In valour,  in war and in conceit there is no one equal to you. You know all means (of success). You are great. You are brave. You are an expert in all deceitful arts.
I have come to you for this purpose seeking your help. Listen to  my words on what you should do:
Be a wonderful golden deer dappled with silver dots and roam in front of Sita in Rama's hermitage.
Seeing you in the form of a deer, Sita will undoubtedly ask her husband and Lakshmana to capture you.
Then during their absence it will be easy for me to abduct Sita in an isolated place without obstruction, like Rahu eclipsing the light of the moon.
Thereafter, when Rama with his soul afflicted due to his wife's abduction. I can freely, happily, successfully strike him down.
At the mention of Rama's name, great Maricha's mouth dried up and he became concerned.
Licking his dried up lips, as though his eyes stopped winking like those of the dead, Maricha stared at Ravana, distressed.
Maricha who knows of Rama's valour was frightened and depressed at heart. He revealed to Ravana with folded hands some facts for mutual benefit.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षट् त्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Having heard the words of Ravana, lord of the demons, wise Maricha who was also an eloquent speaker replied:
O king, it is always easy to find men who speak pleasing words, but it is difficult to get a speaker and a listener who use words unpleasant (to the ears) but beneficial (in life).
You  are fickleminded.  You have employed no spy ( who could have told you the truth about Rama's character). Rama is very brave and virtuous comparable to Indra and Varuna. Surely you are not able to know what Rama is.
O dear may there be good to all the demons in the world. If Rama gets enraged, he will make this world demonless.
Hope the daughter of Janaka is not born to put an end to your life. Hope I will not face any disaster on account of Sita.
I hope the city of Lanka along with the (entire) race of demons will not be destroyed, with a dictator like you who is a slave to sensual pleasure.
A king  who is a slave to passion, who is of bad conduct, of wicked thoughts, advised in evil ways destroys himself, his kith and kin and the entire kingdom.
Rama, the delight of Kausalya, has not forsaken by his father. He has never crossed the limits of dharma. He is not miserly. He has no  bad conduct. He is not a slur on the kshatriyas. He does not lack in righteousness. He is not cruel nor is he engaged in doing harm to others.
O dear, seeing that his truthful father was going to be deceived by Kaikeyi, righteous Rama himself offered to fulfil the promise of his father and came away to the forest.
To satisfy the desire of Kaikeyi and to fulfil his father's word he came to Dandaka forest,  leaving the kingdom and all royal pleasures, behind.
O my dear, Rama is not harsh nor ignorant. It is not that he has no control over the senses. It is not proper  for you to say what is false. You are illinformed.
Rama is dharma incarnate. He is pious. His strength is truth. He is king of all the worlds like Indra to the gods.
Sita is protected by the strength of her character. How do you desire to carry her away forcibly (from Rama) ? Can any one separate the radiance of the Sun from the Sun itself ?
You should not enter into the unquenchable fire that is  Rama,  the fire that has the  arrows (of Rama) as its flames and his sword and bow as fuel.
You should not give up happiness,your dear life and kingdom and come to Rama who is a variable god of death. His bow is  like on open burning mouth, and his flaming arrows are like fire. He is all anger. He is wielder of bow and arrows. He can strike the enemy army (alone).
Immeasurable indeed is the power of Rama to whom Sita, daughter of Janaka belongs. You are not competent to kidnap her, for she is under the refuge of Rama's bow in the forest.
Beautiful Sita happens to be the wife of Rama who is like a lion among men. Rama has a broad chest like that of a lion. He loves Sita who is ever loyal to him, more than his life.
Sita is the darling of mighty Rama. With her slender waist, she is like the leaping flames of blazing fire and it is not possible  for you to touch her.
O chief of the demons, why do you make this futile attempt ? The moment you are seen by Rama in war will be the last of your life.
If you want to enjoy your life, happiness and even the kingdom which is not easily attainable for long, do not incur the displeasure of Rama.
After consulting all your ministers and the righteous persons led by Vibhisana, you may take a decision. Assess the real strength and weakness, merits and demerits  of your own and of Rama. Decide what is good or bad for you and then take steps you deem proper.
O Ravana  I think it is not good on your part to confront the prince of Kosala in a war. Listen to my words and consider what is good for you.इत्यार्षे श्री मद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तत्रिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Once I was roaming the earth, like a mountain possessing the  strength of a thousand elephants, like a dark cloud, wearing bright gold earrings and crown,holding a spear in hand, terrorising the people. I was wandering in Dandaka forest feeding on the flesh of ascetics.
Hence the great sage, righteous Visvamitra afraid of me, went to king Dasaratha  and said:
'O king Maricha has created in me a great fear. Spare the self possessed Rama to protect me while I do the sacrifice.'
When the great, venerable sage Visvamitra said so, the righteous king Dasaratha replied:
'My son Rama is only twelve. He is not experienced in the use of weapons. I shall accompany you with my army.
'O distinguished sage with the four divisions of my army I will slay the enemies you want me to.'
When  the king thus responded to the sage,  he told him that none other than Rama in this world is a match for that demon.
'O king, you have protected even gods in wars and have been a guardian. Your deeds are very wellknown in the three worlds.
'O scourge of foes as you wish, let your great army wait here. Even though Rama is young he is glorious, and capable of subduing the enemy. I will take him. Be blessed.'
Sage Visvamitra saying so took the son of the king and went back very happily to his hermitage.
Then Rama was initiated for the protection of sacrifices and stood on guard, stretching his wonderful bow.
Thereafter, handsome Rama, with eyes like lotus petals, beards ungrown, clad in a single garment with knotted hair on the head, wielding a bow, with a chain of gold, luminous with his own lustre enhanced the glory of Dandaka forest by looking like the young moon just risen.
Then looking like a dark cloud, wearing bright golden earrings, proud of power bestowed on me with boons, I arrived at the hermitage.
I entered at once and lifted my weapons. Rama saw me and unperturbed, started stringing his bow.
Out of my delusion I underestimated the young boy, and screaming, ran towards Visvamitra's sacrificial altar.
Then Rama released a sharp arrow that could kill the enemy. It struck me and threw me at a distance of hundred yojanas into the sea.
O dear being thrown away by the speed of his dart I lost my consciousness. I was protected by Rama who did not want to kill me.
O dear I was thrown into the deep sea and after a long time regained consciousness and  returned to the city of Lanka.
That way I was spared by the young boy who was not versed in archery and who could still accomplish the task with ease.Those who accompanied me were destroyed.
If you pick up conflict with Rama even while being warned by me you will soon face a dreadful calamity.
You will bring grief and disaster into the lives of demons who are sporting in love and who are in the habit of celebrating community festivals with joy.
You will see the city of Lanka dotted with magnificent royal mansions embellished  with different kinds of gems ruined for the sake of Sita.
Even without committing any sin those pure souls because they keep company with sinners will be destroyed for the sins of others just like fishes in a pool of serpents.
You will see the demons who smear their limbs with sandal paste and unguents, who are adorned with excellent ornaments slain and laid on the ground for your mistakes.
You will see the rest of the demons with their wives gone or fleeing in all directions helplessly with none to take care of them.
You will undoubtedly see Lanka filled with arrows, surrounded by flames of fire and its buildings on fire.
O king there is no sin greater than violating the chastity of others wives, when you have married a thousand lovely women.
Enjoy with your wives. Protect your race, prestige, kingdom, prosperity and your own dear life.
If you wish to enjoy your beautiful wives and your good friends for long, do not create enmity with Rama.
If you violate Sita forcibly notwithstanding my friendly warning, your life will be drained by the arrows of Rama and you will reach the abode of Yama with your kith and kin, your strength depleted.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टत्रिंशस्सर्गः।Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
I was somehow saved by him this way in the combat.Listen without any reply to what has taken place recently.
Having done so, I picked up courage and entered Dandaka forest, accompanied by the two other demons in the form of deer .
I wandered in Dandaka forest in the form of a huge animal with a big and strong body, a flaming red tongue and sharp teeth feeding on flesh.
O Ravana, assuming a very dreadful form, I wandered about sacrificial spots, sacred places, river banks, under huge trees planted at quadranglestorturing the ascetics.
I wandered  about the Dandaka forest slaying righteous ascetics, drinking their blood and eating their flesh.
While thus roaming, I harmed the wanderers of the forest. Intoxicated with their blood I used to frighten the righteous.
I encountered again the righteous Rama who was in the form of an ascetic, with venerable Sita and the great warrior Lakshmana.
Although Rama was very strong, he was living on restricted diet, engaged in the welfare of all beings. Treating him as a mere ascetic living in the forest, remembering my past hostility with him and disregarding his (fatal) blow, I ran towards him angrily, assuming the form of a sharphorned animal with an intention to kill him.
His mighty bow drawn, Rama released three sharp darts that came whizzing like Garuda or the wind. They could destroy the enemy.
All the three tightly jointed, welltargetted darts, strong as thunderbolt, and which could feed on blood came together all at once.
Having known Rama's prowess earlier and experienced tremendous fear, I ran away in a bewildered state as I was deceitful. The other two demons (who had accompanied me) succumbed.
With my escape from Rama's darts I somehow got a fresh lease of life. Now I am composed. I have started living the life of a recluse here. I have turned an ascetic.
I see Rama in every tree, clad in bark and deerskin, wielding the bow, holding a noose in hand like the god of death.
O Ravana I see in my fear thousands of Ramas. The entire forest appears to me as though filled with Rama.
O king of the demons  I see only Rama even in solitude. When I see him in a dream  I lose my senses in a state of bewilderment.
O Ravana, every name beginning with the letter 'Ra', such as Ratna (gems), Ratha (chariot), etc. strike terror in me.
I know his power.It is not proper to wage a war with him. Rama, delight of the Raghu dynasty, can slay even Bali or Namuchi.
Missing
There were many pious men in this world who practise yoga and dharma .They have been destroyed along with their retinue due to mistakes committed by others.
O demon   As such, I will perish due to your offence. You may do anything you deem appropriate. I will not follow you.
Rama is brilliant, powerful and strong. I hope he will not be the god of death for the world of demons.
For the sake of Surpanakha, Khara of Janasthana committed excesses and got killed by Rama who can accomplish things with ease.Tell me truly if Rama did violate anything here.
If you do not follow my advice given for the welfare of our kith and kin, O Ravana, you are killed today. With your relations you will succumb to his straightmoving arrows.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The demon Ravana did not heed the appropriate advice of the competent Maricha just like a man wishing to die refuses medicine.
The king of the demons, driven by fate, replied with improper and harsh words to Maricha whose advice was salutary and beneficial to him :
O Maricha, the words addressed to me are not appropriate.Your advice is extremely fruitless like a seed sown in saline, barren soil.
It is not possible to dissuade me from my encounter with Rama who is sinful, foolish and especially an ordinary human being.
On hearing the casual words of a woman, (this) Rama came to the forest at once, leaving his friends, kingdom, mother and father.
In your very presence I will surely abduct Sita, wife of Rama who killed Khara in war, Sita whom he loves more than his life.
O Maricha  I have made up my mind that way. Even demons or deities including Indra cannot alter this decision of mine.
If I asked you the merits or demerits, the risks involved or the way out while deciding a case, you should have said what you did.
A wise counsellor should give advice to the king only when his opinion is sought and that too with folded hands, if he wishes his own prosperity.
A king should be addressed with politeness and decorum, with words not unfavourble intended for his good luck and wellbeing.
A king who deserves honour does not feel happy to hear even good words of advice if said in disrespectful or authoritarian way, O Maricha
Very powerful kings assume five forms like fire, Indra, Moon, Varuna and Yama.
Great kings possess heat, (of the firegod), valour (of Indra), coolness (of the Moon), command (of Varuna) and grace (of the Lord of death). Therefore kings at all stages deserve respect and reverence.
You do not know your rightful duty.Because of delusion and an evil mind, you want to speak only harsh words to me, a guest who has come to you.
O demon  O extremely valiant demon  I ask you(to do) this much now. I am not asking you whether it is good or bad or whether it is for my welfare or not.
You have to help me in accomplishing this great task .Hear me on the kind of work you have to do.
Missing
Transform yourself into a wonderful golden deer with silver spots and move about in front of Sita at the hermitage of Rama. After fascinating her, you may go whereever you desire.
Seeing the illusory golden deer, Sita, wonderstruck, will at once ask Rama to get the deer.
Divert Rama to a faroff place and cry, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana',  imitating the voice of Rama.
On hearing you, Lakshmana will be bewildered. Urged by Sita and out of love for Rama, Lakshmana will follow the same track as Rama.
When Rama and Lakshmana are away I will comfortably abduct Vaidehi like the thousandeyed Indra brought Sachi.
You may go wherever you want after accomplishing this task. I will give you, O demon of determination half my kingdom.
Go and accomplish this task. Let your path be auspicious. I will follow you on the chariot into the Dandaka forest.
I will deceive Rama and obtain Sita, without waging a war. With the work done, I will return to Lanka along with you.
O Maricha if you do not do this, I will kill you now. Or, by force make you do this work. No one who goes against the king lives in comfort.
Your survival is doubtful after facing Rama in combat. But your death is certain if you oppose me now. Think carefuly and do whatever is desirable for you in the present circumstances.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
At this royal command which was against his interest Maracha used harsh words to the demonking:
Who is that sinner who has given you this advice which will spell destruction on you, your sons, your kingdom and your ministers ?
Which sinner is not able to see you happy? O king by whom is this gate of death shown to you cunningly?
This is clear that your enemy demons are now powerless. Hence they want you to be engaged with a stronger power and be destroyed.
O Ravana by which mean fellow is this advice given against your welfare? Who wants you to be destroyed by your own action.
O Ravana the ministers should have prevented you by all means from adopting this  wrong path. Since they have not done so, they deserve to be spain.
Good ministrers should always prevent a lustful king from taking resourse to an evil path. Why were you not stopped, even though you deserve to be checked.
O Ravana  the best among the successful ministers attain piety, prosperity, pleasures and fame by the grace of the king.
Otherwise evrything will become useless, O Ravana  Others will suffer calamities on account of their master's vices.
O Ravana, the best among the victorious indeed the king is at the root of righteousness and victory.Therefore, the king should be protected by all at every stage.
O nightwalking demon  a kingdom cannnot be governed by a king who is rude or hostile or impolite.
Ministers who adopt improper strategies go down along with the king just like swift horses driven by a slow charioteer on a rugged terrain.
Persons who walk the righteous path go down in this world along with their kith and kin due to the mistakes committed by others .
O Ravana, people who are ruled by a cruel and hostile king will not grow like the sheep protected by a jackal.
Under a rude, crooked king whose senses are not under his control the demons will surely perish.
I am faced with  this dreadful disaster accidentally. You will not only be in a miserable state because of your misdeeds, you will perish along with your army.
Rama will kill you not long after killing me.Hence even if I die in the hands of the enemy, my desire will be fulfilled.
Yu most understand that if I die at the very sight of Rama, you along with your relatives will perish with the abduction of Sita.
If you bring Sita from the hermitage with my assistance, know that none of us will surviveyou nor I, nor Lanka , nor the demons.
O Ravana, you do not understand this word of warning coming from your wellwisher. Men who are going to die do not heed the advice given by their friends.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Having thus spoken to the demonking, the distressed Maricha said out of fear, Let both of us go.
If that warrior Rama carrying bow, arrows and sword sees me once again he will raise his weapon to kill me, and I will cease to be.
No one who exhibits his heroism before Rama will come back alive. To you, already hit by Yama's staff, he is another form of the same Yama.
What can I do if you remain evilminded? O dear demon, I am going. May your path be auspicious
Ravana was so overwhelmed with joy to hear those words that he embraced him tightly and said:.
Act according to my wish. It befits your valour. You were a different demon earlier. Now you are Maricha.
Ascend quickly with me this chariot encrusted with gems and yoked with donkeys with devils' faces৷৷
You may go whereever you like after tempting Vaidehi. When the princess of Mithila  is alone, I will bring her by force.
Thereafter Ravana and Maricha ascended the chariot, which was like an aerial car, and quickly departed from that cluster of hermitages.
And likewise, they went past towns, forests, mountains, streams, states and cities.
Ravana, king of the demons, accompanied by Maricha, then reached Dandaka forest and saw Rama's hermitage.
Then Ravana got off the chariot decorated with golden embellishments and, holding Maricha's hand, said:.
O friend here is the site of the hermitage surrounded by banana plants. Quickly get to work on the purpose for which we have come.
Hearing Ravana's words, Maricha transformed himself into a deer and started moving at the entrance of Rama's hermitage.
Maricha assumed the form of a wonderful and magnificent deer with his antlers studded with the most precious gems, his face dappled with luminous spots of white and  black.
The deer's face was like a pink lotus, his ears were like blue lotus. His neck slightly raised, his lips were like petals of blue lotus.
His bright belly was shining like kunda flowers or the Moon or diamond. His flanks were like the golden madhuka flowers. comparable to the filaments of lotus. His hooves were like vaidurya, and his legs were slim and willshaped.
His tail stood up looking magnificent like a colourful rainbow. Bedecked with various gems, he shone beautiful.
Transformed into a most beautiful deer in a moment, Maricha brightened the beautiful forest and Rama's hermitage.
Transfigured into a beautiful, magnificent form painted with the colours of different minerals in order to tempt Sita, Maricha roamed all around the grassland.
That deer with hundreds of silver spots on the body appeared enchanting and pleasing to the eyes while he wandered about nibbling the tender leaves of trees.
The deer went wandering about the banana groves surrounding Rama's hermitage and moved slowly towards the karnikara trees in order to catch the attention of Sita.
That magnificent deer glittered with the colour of blue lotus on its back, wandered merrily in the vicinity of Rama's hermitage.
The wonderful deer moved to and fro, now disappearing and now swiftly returning.
The deer is now sporting, now sitting on the ground, now standing at the entrance of the hermitage and now running with the herds of deer.
Followed by herds of deer and coming back to see Sita again and again, the deer cavorted and pranced and frisked in circles in a wonderful way.
Seeing the deer, other animals wandering in the forest come near and sniffing him run away in all ten directions.
The demon who was interested in killing wild deer touched and felt them but did not kill or feed on them in order to hide his intention.
In the mean time Sita who, with her auspicious looks, was busy plucking flowers drew near the trees.
With her bewitching eyes and beautiful face, Sita, went about plucking flowers from karnikara, ashoka and mango trees.
The great lady Sita, unworthy of dwelling in the forest, saw the wonderful deer decked with gems, with  spots of pearls all over the body.
A lady with beautiful teeth and lips, Sita saw the deer having silver and mineral coloured hair on the body. She gazed at the animal with wonder and joy and love.
That illusory deer saw Rama's wife and moved around wonderfully as if illuminating the forest with his radiance.
Seeing such  an unprecedented deer decorated with different gems, Sita, daughter of Janaka, stood amazed.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Sita while plucking flowers Sita who had fine hips, flawless beautiful limbs and pure golden complexion felt delighted to see the deer with gold and silver colours on both sides of his body. She called out to Rama and Lakshmana who were equipped with arms.
When Sita called Rama and Lakshmana, the two tigers among men, they looked around and saw the deer.
Seeing the deer, Lakshmana suspected him to be Maricha and said this to Rama.
Many kings, while on hunting expedition in the forest, have been deceitfully killed by malicious Maricha, who could assume any form at his free will.
O tiger among men, this deceitful demon (Maricha) has been transformed into the illusory form of a radiant deer which does not exist.
O Rama, lord of the world nowhere on earth does exist this kind of wonderful deer sparkling with gems. That it is a mere trick, an illusion there is no doubt.
Sita was too enchanted by the skin of the deer to retain her sense of discrimination. Intervening, she said to Rama joyfully with a pure smile on her face:
O prince O longarmed one, this deer has captivated my mind. Fetch him for  me.This  will be our playmate.
Here at the hermitage there are many lovely deer, yaks and antelopes wandering in herds.
O longarmed one, most beautiful animals like bears, antelopes and groups of monkeys and kinneras are wandering here.
O prince  this kind of beautiful, tame and glittering deer I have never seen before.
Its body glittering with different colours, speckled with gems of different kinds, is like the Moon shining and illuminating the forest.
Oh what a beauty, Oh what rich call  what delightful, wonderful, graceful limbs  This deer captivates my heart.
If this deer can be caught  alive, it will be thrilling, it will work wonders.
After the completion  of exile in the forest, when we are back in the kingdom, this deer will add beauty to the harem.
O king this deer will create amazement in Bharata, in mothersinlaw, in you and in me as well.
O best among men, if this great deer cannot be captured alive, I will wear its beautiful skin.
If this animal is killed and its golden skin is spread on a tender grass cushion, there will I like to sit.
This kind of request arising out of a woman's desire may sound terrible, still then the beauty of this animal's skin has produced in me a wonder.
By his golden colour resembling the rising Sun, by  his horns with excellent gems shining like the milkyway, even Rama's mind was wonderstruck.
On hearing Sita's words and seeing the wonderful deer, Rama was tempted by its appearance.Prompted by Sita,he joyfully said this to Lakshmana:
O Lakshmana, see the eagerness of Sita. Such a deer of exceptional beauty will not be found in this forest. There is no equal to this animal even in the Nandan garden of Indra, or the Chaitraratha, the garden of Kubera. Where can such an animal be found on earth?
The stretches of hair on the deer's body bent both in the natural order and in the opposite direction look beautiful. The spots of gold on the skin are wonderful.
Look at his tongue stretched out of the mouth while yawning. It is glowing like flaming fire. It is like the lightning sparkling in the cloud.
His face is a drinking pot of emerald, the belly is a conch or a pearl. Whose mind will not be attracted by this indescribable beauty ?
Whose mind will not be filled with wonder on seeing this divine beauty glittering like lustrous gold and studded with a variety of gems ?
O Lakshmana kings who wield  bows  in hunting expeditions kill deer in the forest for  sport as well as for venison.
From huge forests a variety of mineral wealth consisting of gems, stones and gold are collected with great effort.
O Lakshmana the essence of forest wealth is mineral wealth, which helps the growth of the treasury. It is conceived mentally as in the case of Venus.
A materialist moves about thoughtlessly for making money. Economists call it material wealth.
The skins of various types of deer like Priyaki, Kadali or goats or sheep cannot be compared in softness to the skin of this deer.
This majestic deer and the deer flying in heaven (the deer's figure seen in the Moon called Mrgasira)  both the deer of the star in the sky and the deer of the earth are divine.
Lakshmana, as you say, if it is the illusion of a demon, even then it should be killed by me.
The great sages were tortured and killed earlier by this cruel, evilminded Maricha while wandering in the forest.
Many kings who were great archers who set out on hunting expedition were killed by him. Therefore, this animal deserves to be killed.
Earlier in this forest, Vatapi used to humiliate the ascetic brahmins and to kill them by entering into their stomach like a womb killing the female mule.
That Vatapi after a long time, once greedily entered into the stomach of the great lustrous sage Agastya and became his food.
When the venerable sage Agastya got up (after eating), he observed Vatapi wishing to turn into his real form. So smiling at him, he said:
'O Vatapi you killed the best of brahmins living in this world, disregarding them because of your power. Hence you were digested by me.'
O Lakshmana just like Vatapi, this demon will not live. Whoever violates a person of my kind who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled will be killed
O Lakshmana, delight of the Raghu dynasty, be very alert and restrained and protect Sita. Whatever duty we have to perform depends on her protection.
O Lakshmana I will go quickly and either kill the deer or catch it.  Now let me go.
See, how Vaidehi ardently longs for the skin of this deer  I will not let the animal live, O Lakshmana
Keep vigil over Sita at the hermitage, O Lakshmana  I will certainly kill the speckled antelope with a single arrow, get his skin and come back quickly.
O Lakshmana, be vigilant in guarding Sita, suspecting danger every moment from all directions. Take the help of Jatayu, the mighty and wise bird who will be on his rounds.इत्याषे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortythird sarga in Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The brilliant Rama, delight of the Raghu dynasty, thus instructed his brother and fastened a sword with a golden handle to his waist.
A man of indomitable prowess, he took the bow with three curves that was like an ornament to him, tied two quivers at the back and left.
On seeing Rama approaching him, the deer disappeared due to fear and again came within sight. With his sword and the bow, Rama chased wherever the deer ran.
Rama, wielder of the bow, saw that splendid animal ahead of him. Holding the bow he saw the deer running away, bewldered into the great forest looking at him again and again. The deer was getting out of the range of his arrow, while it enticed him now and then. Suspecting that he might be caught,  the deer was, as though jumping into the sky. Now it came within sight and now out of sight in the huge forest. It looked like the autumnal moon surrounded by clouds. (The clouds muffle the Moon and reveal him now and then).
Maricha, transformed into a deer, was seen now near, now faroff. He pulled Rama away from the hermitage through his exits and entrances.
Deluded by that deer, Rama got tired, perplexed and angry. Then bewidered, he waited on a grassland under a shade.
That demon transformed himself into a deer and, surrounded by the animals of the forest at close range, attracted his attention.
Seeing Rama's  intention to catch him, the deer ran away once again out of fear and disappeared in a moment.
Resplendent Rama saw the deer coming out of a cluster of trees at a distance and determined to kill him.
Powerful Rama, destroyer of foes, lifted in a rage his arrow blazing like the light of  the Sun, strung it to his sturdy bow and drew it with all his force. He then aimed at the deer and released the shining  arrow created by Brahma which went hissing like a  serpent.
The great arrow which was like a thunderbolt first pierced into the body of Maricha who had assumed the form of a deer and then tore his heart.
And, hurt by the dart, Maricha roared frighteningly, leaped as high as a  palm tree  and dropped down on earth almost dead.
Maricha gave up his false form of the deer and before breathing his last, remembered the words of Ravana. He thought over the means through which Sita could send Lakshmana to this spot so that  Ravana would abduct her when she is alone.
Then Maricha realised that the appropriate time had come. In a voice similar to Rama's, he shouted loudly 'Alas Sita, Alas Lakshmana '
Struck in the vital part by Rama's matchless dart, Maricha gave up the form of the deer and assumed his huge body of the demon.
Seeing that terrific demon fallen on the ground, drenched in blood, and strring his limbs, Rama thought of Lakshmana's words and reached Sita mentally (thought of her).
This is an illusion created by Maricha. It happened exactly the way Lakshmana had said earlier. Maricha is now killed.
This demon Maricha screamed aloud saying, 'Alas, Sita, Alas, Lakshmana'. He is now dead. How would Sita react to this voice? What would be the condition of Lakshmana? While righteous Rama reflected on this, his hair stood on end.
After killing the demon in the figure of a deer and hearing his voice, Rama was overtaken by intense fear born of despair.
Then Rama killed another deer, collected the venison and hastened to Janasthana.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुश्चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।Thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing the voice in distress and recognising that it was similar to her husband's voice, Sita said to Lakshmana, 'Go and find out Rama's whereabouts'.
I clearly heard Rama calling out in great distress. Indeed, my heart as well as my life is not in its place (restless). You ought to go and protect your brother who is crying in pain in the forest.
Like a bull caught by lions, your brother is seeking help caught by demons. You should run at once to your brother.
When he did not budge in obedience to his brother's order (to protect Sita), the daughter of Janaka in a rage said :
Since you, O son of Sumitra,  are not reaching out to your brother in this situation, you are an enemy to your brother in the guise of a friend৷৷
It is possess me that you wish Rama's death. You do not rush to him certainly because of greed for me.
I think Rama's adversity is welcome to you. You do not have any love towards your brother. It is for this that you stand unconcerned instead of proceeding to help your brilliant brother.
When he for whose service you have primary come here, has met with difficulty, what is the use of your being here? What purpose you serve by staying here with me ?
While Sita thus spoke, flooded with tears of sorrow, frightened like a doe, Lakshmana replied :
O Vaidehi there is no doubt that pannagas, asuras, gandharvas, gods, men or even demons cannot defeat him.
O brilliant Devi  none  among gods or men, gandharvas, birds or goblins kinnaras, wild animals or dreadful demons can encounter Rama in war.
Rama is indestructible in war. It is not proper for you to say what you said. When he is not here I do not wish to leave you alone here in the forest.
He cannot be stopped by the strength of the mighty, or by Indra supported by gods or by the wellequipped armies of all the three worlds.
May your heart be relieved (of this fear)  Give up this grief. Your husband will soon return with the excellent deer killed.
Surely it is not his voice. It is contrived by some one's illusory power. It is the illusion created by that demon, like the city of the gandharvas. (which does not exist.)
O best of women Vaidehi  great Rama has entrusted your safty to me. I do not wish to leave you here alone.
O Vaidehi since the killing of Khara and the residents of Janasthana we have developed enmity with the demons.
These demons wander about tormenting others and spreading rumours of all kinds. You need not worry about them.
Addressed thus by Lakshmana, Sita got mighty angry. Her eyes turned red and she spoke harshly to truthful Lakshmana
O ignoble, cruel Lakshmana, you are a disgrace to your family. I think this great disaster of Rama is a pleasure to you.
O Lakshmana,do you speak such words seeing the disaster of Rama?  No wonder that cruel men who always move like you in disguise will thus resort to sinful action against rivals.
You are very wicked. You are hiding your true identity, and employed by Bharata, you are following Rama in the forest as he is alone.
O Lakshmana such intention of yours or even of Bharata's will not be fulfilled. I have held the hands of Rama who has eyes like the lotus petal, who has the complexion of the blue lotus. How can I prefer some other man?
I will undoubtedly give up my life in your presence.I will not live even for a moment on earth without Rama, O son of Sumitra
The selfcontrolled Lakshmana with folded palms replied to Sita's harsh, horripilating words:
O princess from Mithila, I do not want to use such harsh words. To me you are a deity (worthy of adoration). It is not surprising that women of the world use such undeserving words. It is their nature.
Women devoid dharma are fickle and inconsistent. They use sharp, piercing words. O daughter of Janaka, O princess from Videha, your words pierce my ears like redhot darts.I cannot tolerate them.
I speak what is just while you use harsh and unjust words. Let all beings who move in the forest bear witness.
Fie upon you. Like a woman of wicked nature you doubt me when I stood firm by my brother's words. You will go to ruin.
O beautiful lady, I will go to Rama wherever he may be. Be happy. O largeeyed one, may  all the deities of the forest protect you.
O daughter of Janaka O princess from Videha, I see dreadful omens. I do not know whether I will see you when I am back with Rama.
At these words of Lakshmana Sita started crying. With eyes filled with tears she replied with harshness :
O Lakshmana without Rama I will drown myself in Godavari or hang myself or leap from a cliff into death.
I will drink deadly poison or enter fire and die, but will not touch any other man even with my feet.
Thus Sita cried in distress, sadly hitting her belly with both the hands, blaming Lakshmana (all the time).
Saumitri saw  the largeeyed, dejected Sita crying in distress.He pacified and consoled her but she did not say anything at all to her husband's brother.
Lakshmana, brother of Rama, hurt by the harsh words of Sita, hastened with Rama's wellbeing in mind.
The tenheaded Ravana who was in hiding assumed the guise of a wandering mendicant and approached Sita.
And then Ravana wearing fine orange robes, with hair knotted on the head, carrying a parasol, wearing sandals, hanging a kamandalu (waterpot), and a staff on the auspicious left shoulder walked towards Vaidehi like a mendicant.
Mighty Ravana approached Sita deprived of both the brothers, Like darkness encompasses the evening twilight in the absence of the Sun and the Moon.
The extremely cruel Ravana saw the illustrious young wife of Rama just as Ketu looks at Rohini star in the absence of the Moon.
Seeing the ferocious Ravana, the huge trees at Janasthana shook vidently. Even the wind ceased to blow.
Seeing Ravana with his bloodred eyes, the swiftflowing river Godavari slowed down out of fear.
The tenheaded Ravana who was waiting for Rama's absence now got it. Disguised as a mendicant he stepped toward to where Sita was.
The evilminded Ravana in the guise of a holy man, like Saturn moves towards Chitra star, came close to Sita who was brooding over her husband.
Just like a well is concealed by an overgrowth of grass, Ravana guised as a holy man stood looking at illustrious Sita, the wife of Rama.
The wicked demon came close to that auspicious princess from Videha sitting in the cottage Her face was like the full moon. Her teeth and lips were lovely. She was clad in yellow silk. Her eyes were like lotus petals tormented by tears of grief.
Sita was the most lovely lady of the world shining in beauty. She was like the goddess of wealth (Laxmi) without her lotus. Ravana praised her thus:
Who are you with a golden complexion, clad in yellow silk, and looking like a lotuspond and wearing an auspicious lotus garland?
O lady with a beautiful face, with lovely thighs, are you 'hri', shyness personified? Are you the auspicious lovely Lakshmi, the  goddess of wealth? Are you the goddess of fame? Are you an apsara? Are you Bhuti, the goddess of fortune? Or are you Rati, the goddess of love moving at your free will ?
Your teeth are even and pointed, white and beautiful.Your eyes are large and clear and sparkling with dark pupils with a red tinge at the corner.
Your big hips are stout and strong, Your smooth thighs are like the trunk of an elephant, your breasts adorned with gems, are round and robust like palm fruits and drooping with heaviness with projected stiff nipples, shining and delightful, adding beauty.
O lady with an elegant smile, beautiful teeth, lovely  eyes you are enticing.Your slender waist can be compassed by my fist.Your hair is beautiful and your large breasts are rubbing against each other.You are capturing my mind  just as the flow of water in a river  touches its banks.
O beautiful lady I have not seen such a beauty earlier either among goddesses or among gandharavis, or yakshis or even among kinneris.
You are the most beautiful among women in the world. With all your tenderness and youth you are living in this forlorn forest. This maddens my heart.
You deserve to stroll in the terraces of palaces, in beautiful, luxurious and fragrant city gardens.
O beautiful, blackeyed lady, I think you deserve the best of garlands, best of food, and clothes and a suitable husband.
O best of women O lady with beautiful buttocks  can you be one  of the Rudras or Maruts or Vasus? To me, you appear like a goddess.
Neither gandharvas, nor kinnaras, nor gods move here. This is only a dwelling place for the demons. How did you come here ?
There are monkeys, lions, panthers, tigers, hyenas, bears, kanka birds and other wild animals here. How is it that you are not afraid of them?
O Charming lady how is it that although alone you are not afraid of the dreadful, swift, powerful wild animals like elephants in rut ?
Who are you, O auspicious lady ? Who are your people? Why are you here? From where have you come? For what reason are you going about alone in this fierce Dandaka tract, inhabited by demons?
Seeing Ravana, a villain in the guise of a brahmin praising her, Sita, the princess of Videha, honoured him with all hospitality.
She offered the handsome guest a seat first and then water for washing his feet with, and then invited him for food.
Sita, being a lady, was unable to doubt him since he came in the guise of a brahmin, holding a bottlegourd and a begging bowl. Without knowing his illintention she invited him in, mistaking him for a brahmin.
O brahmin, here is the seat for you. Feel free to sit. Here is water to wash your feet with. This is the best of food for you collected from the forest. Please partake this without hesitation.
Ravana was observing the princess from Mithila, wife of a king inviting him  and speaking to him in cordial manner. Looking at her, he resolved to  abduct her forcibly, inviting his own death.
Sita looked out for the beautiful figure of Rama who had gone to hunt the deer along with Lakshmana. Waiting eagerly for her husband, she only saw the vast stretch of green forest  but not Rama and Lakshmana.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षट्चत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Then Ravana in the guise of a mendicant with crooked intention to abduct her, asked Vaidehi to tell him about herself.
'He is a brahmin and also a guest. If unanswered he may curse me'. Thinking this Sita thought for a moment and said:
O best of brahmins be pleased to know I am Sita by name, daughter of the great Janaka, king of Mithila and wife of Rama.
I lived in the house of the Ikshvakus for twelve years and enjoyed all kinds of pleasures meant for mortals.
In the thirteenth year, the king and lord Dasaratha consulted other kings and ministers to consecrate Rama.
Arrangements for consecration were on when queen Kaikeyi sought a boon from the king.
For the fulfilment of the promise made to Kaikeyi earlier by my truthful fatherin law, who, to my good luck, was the best of kings, she asked for two boons. One was banishment of my husband and second, consecration of Bharata.
'I shall not eat, or sleep or even drink if Rama is consecrated and I shall put an end to my life itself' (said Kaikeyi).
The king, my fatherinlaw, who respected her offered riches. Which she did not accept.
My husband who was very bold was twentyfive years and I had completed eighteen years since my birth.
My husband known in the world as Rama is largeeyed, longarmed, virtuous, truthful, pure and is always engaged in the welfare of all beings.
The brilliant king, Dasaratha, father of Rama, overcome by passion,  did not consecrate Rama in order to please Kaikeyi.
When my husband Rama approached his father for the consecration she said these unhesitating words:
'O Rama, listen, your father has ordered that this kingdom be bestowed on Bharata without any obstacles.
'O Rama of the Kakutstha dynasty, you should live in the forest for fourteen years and save your father from falsehood'.
My husband Rama, a man of fearlessness and firm resolution, said to Kaikeyi 'Be it so' and carried out her words.
O brahmin this is his firm resolve and his great vow: 'One should give and never take one should speak the truth and nothing but he truth.'
Son to the second mother of Rama, his mighty halfbrother, by name, Lakshmana, a tiger among men and a  slayer of enemies in battle is a companion to him.
Lakshmana, his brother, is righteous and steadfast. Bow in hand, he followed Rama along with me, into exile.
Rama who is ever righteous and selfcontrolled entered the Dandaka forest with matted locks, his brother and me.
O best of brahmins three of us have been wandering with courage in the deep forest, dislodged from  the kingdom on account of  Kaikeyi.
Rest here awhile. My husband will return with plenty of meat of many kinds from the forest, killing deer, alligators and wild boars.
O brahmin, tell me your name, your gotra and your pedigree. And the purpose for which you are going about all alone in this Dandaka forest
To these words of Sita, Rama's wife, Ravana, the powerful king of demons, replied  sharp:
O Sita I am called Ravana, the lord of demons by whom all the worlds of demons, snakes and gods are frightened.
O flawless beauty of golden complexion seeing you clad in silk, I am not inclined to show any interest in my own wives.
You will be the chief queen among the best of women I have won in wars. Be blessed.
My great city  called Lanka is on the peak of a mountain surrounded by, and in the middle of, the sea.
O Sita, you can stroll with me in my pleasuregardens. O  beautiful lady, you will not like living in the forest (thereafter).
O Sita  if you become my wife, five thousand female attendants adorned with all ornaments will attend on you.
Thus addressed by Ravana, Janaki, a lady of blemishless limbs, got enraged and replied without caring for the demon:
I am devoted to Rama, my husband, who is unshakeable like a huge mountain, is comparable to lord Indra and is imperturbable like the mighty ocean.
I am the loyal wife of venerable Rama who is endowed with all excellences, a refuge to all like  a spreading banyan tree, and a votary of truth.
I am the faithful wife of the longarmed, broadchested  Rama,  a lion among men. His gait is the gait of an advancing, invincible lion.
I am the devoted wife of great Rama, whose face is like a fullmoon, who is the son of a king, who has conquered his senses and whose fame is widespread (on earth).
You are a jackal, and you want a lioness like me who is difficult to win. I am like the Sun's radiance whom you cannot even touch.
O luckless Ravana  you want the beloved wife of Rama.You will, for sure, see golden trees. (which those close to death do).
You are seeking to pull the teeth from  the mouth of a hungry and powerful lion who is considered the enemy of the deer(which you are). You intend to pull the fang of a poisonous snake.
You are trying to carry the greatest of mountains, the Mandara, with one hand. You are wishing to go safe after drinking deadly poison (produced from the churning of the ocean).
You wish to violate the loving wife of Rama. You are rubbing your eyes with a needle and licking the razor with your tongue.
You want to assault Rama's dear wife. It is like girding a stone round the neck and trying to cross the sea.It is like intending to take the Sun and the Moon with both your hands.
You intend to assaut the wife of Rama, who is a lady of virtuous conduct. You wish to hold blazing fire in your cloth.
You want to acquire Rama's worthy wife. You wish to walk on sharp ironheaded spear.
The difference between you and Rama is the difference between a jackal and a lion in the forest, between a ditch and the sea, and between sour gruel and the best of wines.
The difference between you and Rama is the difference  between gold and lead, sandal and slime, an elephant and a cat of the forest.
The difference between you and Dasaratha's son is the difference between a crow and Garuda, a watercrane and a peacock, a vulture and a swan in the forest.
So long Rama, equal in prowess to the thousandeyed Indra stands with bow and arrows in hand, I will not, although abducted, wither away like a diamond gulped by an insect (fly).
Having said thus to the wicked nightwalker Ravana, Sita, pure in thought remained  distressed.Her slender body started trembling like a banana plant becomes shaken by a violent wind.
Beholding Sita who was trembling, Ravana, powerful like death, started telling about himself, his clan, his strength and his deeds to instil more fear in her.इत्तयार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Addressed thus by Sita, Ravana, his anger roused, knitted his eyebrows with a frown on his forehead and replied to her harshly:
O paragon of beauty  I am the halfbrother of Kubera, born of his stepmother. I am known as the tenheaded, powerful Ravana. Be blessed
Just as people get scared of death, all (creatures) including gandharvas, gods, evil spirits, birds and snakes run away from me.
For some reason or other a duel took place between me and king Kubera. With my prowess, I defeated him in the duel.
Out of fear for me, Kubera is residing on the mighty mount Kailasa, leaving his own earlier prosperous place of residence.
O noble lady  with my valour I gained over from Kubera the aerial chariot 'Pushpaka', which can go wherever one desires and in which I move about in the sky.
O Princess from Mithila, seeing my angry face  even gods led by Indra take to their heels in fear.
Wherever I am, the Windgod blows with hesitation. So are the Sun and the Moon afraid of me. Afraid of me the Sun duly discharges his duties.
Wherever I stay or move about, the leaves of trees do not shake, and the waters in rivers remain still.
My city known as Lanka, teeming with terrific demons, is on the other side of the sea. It is  beautiful like the city of Indra's Amaravati.
The beautiful city of Lanka  shines with its pale white ramparts and golden interiors. The entrance gates are encrusted with vaidurya (cat'seye).
It is crowded with elephants, horses and chariots. It resounds with the music of trumpets. The trees in the delightful pleasuregardens yield fruits in all seasons.
O highminded princess, O Sita while living with me, you will not even think of other women.
O blessed lady of fine complexion, while enjoying both human and heavenly  pleasures with me there, you will not remember Rama who is a mortal of short lifespan.
Considering the eldest son a weakling, king Dasaratha has sent him away to the forest so that he could consecrate his dear son(Bharata).
O largeeyed Sita dislodged from the kingdom, Rama has lost his capacity to think. He is doing penance, assuming an ascetic role. What can he do (for you)?
I am lord of all the demons. You should not reject me I am here (only because I am) overcome by the arrows of the god of love.
O timid lady if you reject me, you will regret like Urvasi who kicked Pururava and regretted later.
O lady of fine complexion, Rama is a (mere) mortal. In war he is no match (even) for my finger. It is your good fortune that you have got me here. Take refuge in me.
Thus addressed, Sita was enraged and her eyes turned red. She replied in harsh words to the chief of the demons in that solitary place:.
Why do you wish to do something inauspicious by calling Lord Kubera who is worshipped by all beings your brother ?
O Ravana ,you are cruel and evilminded. You have no control over your senses. (And yet) you are the ruler of your breed. Surely they are going to be destroyed.
It may be possible (for some one) to live after abducting Indra's wife, Sachi, but it is not possible for any one to live after kidnapping the wife of Rama.
O demon, you may live long after forcibly snatching the most beautiful Sachi, from the hands of Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, but after abusing a woman like me, you will not be released from death even if you drink nectar.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टचत्वारिंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortyeighty sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing the Sita's words, the powerful Ravana struck his palms one over the other and assumed a huge form (original figure).
Ravana again said to that princess from Mithila, I suppose you are too insane to disregard my strength and valour.
Standing in the sky, I can  lift the earth with my arms.  I can drink the oceans. I can kill even the god of death in a combat.
I can obstruct the Sun and shatter the earth with my sharp arrows. O mad woman I am a husband who can fulfil your desires, and can assume any form at my own free will. Look at me.
As Ravana exploded in anger, his ambercoloured eyes turned red like the radiance of the flaming fire, and almost as bright as the Sun.
Ravana, brother of Kubera, shed the gentle figure of a mendicant and assumed the form of the god of death.
Overcome by intense anger, Ravana's eyes reddened. The nightranger, stood armed with bow and arrows and shining with glittering gold ornaments, appeared like a black cloud.
Ravana, chief of the demons, shed the mendicant's form and assumed his real self. Clad in red garments, his eyes turned red in anger. Looking like layers of clouds, he stood in front of Sita, a gem among women.
Ravana said to the princess from Mithila, whose black hair was shining, who was luminous like the Sun and was clad in the best of cothes and ornaments.
O beautiful lady  if you desire a husband who is famous in the three worlds, take refuge in me. I am fit to be your husband.
I am your praiseworthy husband. I will not cause any unpleasantness to you at any time. Abandon on your inclination towards, a (mere) mortal. Divert your love to me.
O stupid woman you think you are very wise. What is there in Rama so that you are attached to him ? He has left the kingdom and his kith and kin due to the words of a woman. He has not accomplished anything (in life). He has a limited life span and now lives in this forest haunted by wild animals.
Just as Budha (planet Mercury) catches Rohini (a cluster of five stars) in the sky, the evilminded, infatuated Ravana advanced towards the pitiable, pleasing Sita and caught hold of her.
Ravana seized with his left hand the lotuseyed Sita by the hair and lifted her by the thighs with his right hand.
The sylvan deities fled out of fear on seeing the dreadful appearance of Ravana who had sharp teeth and mighty arms. He looked like a mountain, a veritable god of death.
There arrived the great  golden chariot of Ravana, illusive and wonderful, harnessed with donkeys and braying like donkeys.
Reproaching the princess from Videha loudly and harshly, Ravana took her on his lap and put her on the chariot.
Seized by Ravana, illustrious Sita screamed aloud Alas, Rama. for one who was far away in the forest.
Passionate Ravana took hold of Sita who was not willing and was writhing in pain. He seized her  like (an eagle carrying away) a serpent queen and flew up.
While Sita was being carried off in the sky by the king of demons,   she screamed a lot in agony and anxiety like a mad woman in a bewildered state:
Alas, O longarmed Lakshmana, you who used to entertain your brother do not know that I am being carried away by this ruthless demon.
O Rama, you have given up your life, pleasure and treasure for the sake of righteousness. Do you not see me carried off by an unrighteous fellow ?
O scorcher of enemies you are the chastiser of the haughty. Why do you not punish such a sinner like Ravana.
The effect of arrogant action cannot be seen right away. Just as the crop yields results only after ripening, in the same way it takes time. Time acts as a supporting factor.
Time has taken a toll of your senses. This has made you do what you have done. A great calamity is awaiting you in the hands of Rama. It will end your life.
Alas, the lawful wife of the glorious and righteous Rama is being abducted now. Let Kaikeyi along with her relations be happy with her desire fulfilled.
O karnikar trees in full bloom in Janasthana, tell Rama quickly that Ravana is kidnapping Sita.
I salute to Malyavan and  Prasravana mountains. Tell Rama at once that Ravana is carrying away Sita.
O river Godavari abounding in swans and cranes, my salutations to you  Tell Rama immediately that Ravana is taking away Sita.
I offer my salutations to different deities residing in this forest abounding in trees of many kinds. Tell my husband about me that I am being whisked away.
I seek refuge in all those living beings as well as herds of animals and birds in the forest.
Tell Rama that his dear wife Sita whom he loves more than his life is abducted helplessly.
If he knows that I am abducted by Yama, the god of death, that mighty, longarmed hero will save me even from there by virtue of his valour.
When the griefstricken, largeeyed Sita was lamenting piteously, she saw the vulture (Jatayu) seated on a tree.
The heavyhipped Sita felt frightened in the grip of Ravana. When she saw Jatayu she screamed, shaken by sorrow:
O Jatayu, see me now being carried away by the sinful king of demons in this pitiable condition as though I am an orphan.
This nightranger is equipped with weapons. Cruel, strong and evilminded, he has won wars. You cannot stop him.
O Jatayu narrate to Rama and Lakshmana the exact facts of my abduction and all the details without any omission.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While reposing, Jatayu heard the cry and at once looked up and saw Ravana and Vaidehi.
Glorious Jatayu, the best among the birds, looked like the peak of a mountain.His beak was sharp. His words were auspious. He spoke from the top of the tree:
O tenheaded Ravana, I am Jatayu, king of vultures. I am mighty. An eternal follower, of dharma, I am an adherent to truth.
Rama, Dasaratha's son, is the king of the entire world. He is equal to Indra and Varuna. He is ever engaged in the welfare of the entire world.
The lady you want to abduct from here is the famous Sita, the lawful wife of Rama, the lord of the world.
How can a king who adheres to righteousness outrage another's wife ? O powerful one, a king's wife in particular should be protected.
Refrain yourself from the vile thought of violating other's wives. Wise men do not adopt what is censured by others. Just like one's own, the wise should protect other's wives.
O son of Paulastya learned men determine the path of dharma artha and kama,  following a king's conduct even if  they are not declared in sastras.
A king is the best repository of rigteousness, material wealth and pleasures. The king is the root of dharma, virtue and sin.
O best of demons  by nature you are sinful, and fickleminded. You do all forbidden acts. Otherwise,how could you get this wealth, like the celestial chariot?
Indeed, it is not possible to erase the nature of any one, whatever it be. Prosperity does not rest for long in the house of the evilminded.
Powerful and righteous Rama has not offended you, your kingdom or your city. Why do you offend him?
On account of Surpanakha, Khara trespassed into Janasthana and got killed by Rama, without much effort. Tell me truly, what transgression (of dharma) did he commit for which you are stealing away the wife of Rama who is the lord of this world?.
Leave Vaidehi at once lest with her fierce looks you should be burnt down like demon Vrtra by the thunderbolt of Indra.
You are not aware that you are tying a venomous snake with the skirt of your cloth. worn by you. You are not able to see the noose of death tightened around your neck.
O gentle Ravana one should carry that much of weight which does not tire him. One should eat only that wholesome food which can be easily digested.
Who will do such a deed which cannot beget dharma, fame or glory in the world? Who will do such deeds that bring only exhaustion to the body?
Sixty thousand years ago I was born, O Ravana  Since then I have ruled justly my hereditary kingdom.
I am old, you are young, wielding a bow and arrows, with shield to protect and chariot to ride. Even then I will not let you go safe with Vaidehi kidnapped.
You cannot carry Vaidehi by force within my very sight just as the everlasting revelations of the Vedas cannot be robbed by mere logic of reason.
O Ravana, if you are brave, fight with me. In a moment, you will be killed like Khara and lie down on the ground.
Clad in bark garments, Rama, who has often slain demons in the past will soon kill you in war.
What can I do? O mean fellow the two princes have gone far away.You will soon be destroyed out of fear for them. There is no doubt.
I will not let you take away the auspicious, lotuseyed Sita, the dear consort of Rama as long as I am alive.
I should do this important work of those great souls, Rama and Dasaratha, even if it claims my life.
O ten headed Ravana stay, stay for a while. O demon  as long as I am alive I will treat you with the hospitality of war. You will be pulled down from this best of the chariots like a ripe fruit drops from the stalk.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Ravana's twenty eyes glowed like fire in anger after Jatayu thus rightly said.
As the bright gold earrings of the intolerant king of demons glittered, his eyes turned red in rage and he pounced upon Jatayu, the lord of birds.
The clash between them was tumultuous and it appeared like the clash of two pieces of clouds in the sky raised by stormy winds.
The duel between Ravana and Jatayu looked as though it was a fight between two huge winged mountains of Malyavan range.
Then the mighty Ravana rained sharp, dreadful shafts, spears and Vikarnis at Jatayu,  king of vultures.
Jatayu, lord of the birds, faced the arrows and other weapons showered  by Ravana.
The mighty, virtuous vulture with his sharp claws wounded many parts of the body of Ravana.
Ravana in a rage took ten dreadful darts (looking) like the staff of death with a desire to crush the enemy.
The mighty Ravana fully released his dreadful, sharp arrows that went straight and pierced the vulture.
Seeing Sita, daughter of Janaka, on the demon's chariot with eyes full of tears, Jatayu without minding the arrows renewed his attack.
The glorious lord of birds crushed with his feet the bow and arrow of Ravana with pearls and gems encrusted.
Overcome with anger, Ravana took another bow and rained (on him) hundreds and thousands of arrows.
Jatayu, shot with arrows on all sides in the combat, shone like the bird that returned to its nest.
Powerful Jatayu scattered the shower of arrows with his wings and broke down the great bow with his claws.
Mighty Jatayu, lord of the birds, shattered with his wings the armour of Ravana that was glowing like fire.
Powerful Jatayu killed in the combat, the splendid, swiftmoving, devilfaced asses with  golden shields yoked to the chariot.
Then he(Jatayu) broke down the great chariot(of Ravana) glowing like fire, glittering with gold and gems, made of three bamboo reeds, and capable of flying wherever the rider willed.
Jatayu violently pulled down the parasol shining like the full moon and the fans of the chariot along with the demons holding them.
Again the glorious, powerful king of birds swiftly shattered the huge head of the charioteer with his beak.
With the bow broken, the chariot destroyed, asses (drawing the chariot) and the charioteer dead,  Ravana fell down on the ground holding Vaidehi on his lap.
Seeing Ravana fallen on the ground with his broken chariot, all beings honoured the king of the birds, saying, Well done Well done
Seeing the lord of the flocks of birds exhausted due to age still fighting, Ravana felt glad. He flew back into the sky taking Sita, princess of Mithila, with him.
Seeing Sita, Janaka's daughter, happily carried away into the sky by Ravana on his lap. Jatayu, the mighty king of vultures chased him, and obstructing his path said :
Foolish Ravana, you are kidnapping this lady, wife of Rama, whose arrows can hit like a thunderbolt. This will lead to the destruction of all demons.
You are drinking poison along with all your friends, relatives, ministers, the army and  your allies. like a thirsty man drinks water.
Fools who do not know the consequences of their action perish soon. Similarly you are going to die soon.
You are bound by the noose of death like a fish holding on to the bait of the fishing hook. Where can you go now?
O Ravana  know that Rama and Lakshmana, the Kakutsthas, are invincible. They will not forgive the asssault you have made on their hermitage.
Your cowardly action will be condemned by the whole world. The path you have chosen is the path of a thief and not of a hero.
O Ravana if you are courageous, tarry awhile and fight with me. Like your brother Khara, you will lie on the ground dead.
You have resorted to unrighteous action like a dying man. This will spell your destruction.
If the consequences of an action be sin, who will do it ? Even the selfborn lord of the world may not.
Brave Jatayu having thus said these cautious words to the demon dashed against his back again and again.
Thereafter, seizing Ravana, Jatayu ascended on his back and pierced his body all over with his sharp claws just as a rider goads an unruly elephant.
Jatayu who had  his claws, wings and beak as the only weapons  pierced and pricked  Ravana all over with his nails by pressing his beak on his back and pulled out his hair.
Thus tormented again and again by the king of vultures, Ravana shook with anger, his lips quivering.
Losing his senses, with rage, Ravana held Vaidehi (Sita) with his left arm and hit Jatayu with his palm.
Then Jatayu, lord of the birds, subduer of enemies, overpowered Ravana and dismembered his ten left arms with his beak.
As the left arms were cut off, there came out from them all the ten arms instantaneously like serpents emitting poisonous flames from anthills
Then the tenheaded Ravana left Sita and attacked Jatayu with his fists and feet out of anger.
Between the warriors of unequal valour, Ravana and Jatayu, the chief of the demons and the foremost of the birds, the fight took place for a moment.
Ravana lifted his sword and cut off both the wings and feet of Jatayu who was fighting relentlessly (for Rama's sake).
(Seriously) wounded and almost dead,the vulture fell down on the ground all at once, when his wings were chipped by the demon of terrible deeds.
Sita, princess of Videha, saw the wounded Jatayu fallen on the ground drenched in blood. Grieving, she ran towards him as if he was her relative.
Lord of Lanka saw that very bold Jatayu of dark blue colour of the cloud, fair chest, fallen on the ground, looking like the forest fire that had been put out.
Sita, daughter of Janaka, whose face was radiant like the Moon once again embraced  Jatayu, the winged warrior, fallen on the ground, crushed by Ravana's onslaught and wept.इतयार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Sita,whose face was like the lord of the stars (Moon), saw Jatayu, king of birds, struck down by Ravana, and lamented in extreme grif :
People, for sure, foresee weal and woe in life from auspicious symptoms and ominous sounds.
O Rama you are, indeed, unaware of the great disaster that has befallen you. All the animals and birds are running for my sake to tell you about me, O scion  of the Kakutsthas.
'This bird that came forward to save me is hit by the sinner(Ravana) and lies down on the ground, as ill luck would have it.
Terribly frightened, the beautiful lady (Sita) cried bitterly, 'O Rama, O Lakshmana, save me', as if they were close by and were listening to her.
Ravana, king of the demons, ran towards Sita who was weeping like an orphan with her garlands and ornaments crushed.
Separated from Rama in the forest, Sita hugged huge trees, running round and round like a creeper coiled, crying loudly, 'Rama, O Rama' . The king of the demons, like Yama, caught hold of her hair only to invite his death, all the time saying, Leave it, Leave it  (Leave the tree).
While Sita was being assaulted, the earth with the animate and the inanimate crossed all limits of moral law and became enveloped in blinding darkness. The wind  ceased to blow and the Sun, to shine.
Brahma, the glorious Grandfather, saw with his divine eyes, Sita in a desperate state caught by the enemy and said, 'The task is accomplished.
All the great seers residing in Dandaka forest felt both happy and sad, happy because the destruction of Ravana is at hand and sad because Sita was in distress.
While Sita was crying, 'O Rama, O Lakshmana', Ravana, lord of the demons, carried her back into the sky.
SIta who had put on pure gold ornaments on her body and who was clad in yellow silk  shone like lightning.
Ravana was shining all the more with(her) yellow clothes blowing in the air, and looked like a mountain shining with fire burning around.
The red lotus petals worn by the most auspicious Sita, princess of Videha, were showered on Ravana.
As the goldencoloured garment worn by Sita blew in the wind, it looked like a coppercoloured cloud illumined by the evening Sun in the sky.
Sita's face with her beautiful nose on Ravana's lap and not on Rama's, shone no more like a lotus without its stalk.
Sita's face looked beautiful with her smooth forehead, shining hair and spotless complexion like the inside of a lotus, with clean, white, shining teeth, a nice nose and lovely red lips. She was continuously weeping and wiping her tears. Her face which was pleasing like the Moon on the lap of Ravana appeared as though the Moon was rising through dark clouds.
Shaken up by the demon and deprived of Rama's company, Sita's beautiful face looked like the Moon during daytime without any glow.
Goldencomplexioned Sita, princess of Mithila, held by the darkcoloured king of the demons, shone like a girdle resting on a dark blue sapphire.
Bright like a golden lotus, adorned with gold ornaments, Sita, the daughter of Janaka, held by Ravana, looked like a streak of lightning shining bright in a dark cloud.
The lord of the demons by the side of Sita, princess of Videha with her jingling ornaments looked like the darkblue raincloud with its lightning and thunder.
As Sita was being carried away, the shower of flowers dropped from her head and scattered on the earth.
The shower of flowers that fell flew towards the tenheaded Ravana again in the swirling motion (of the chariot).
The shower of flowers that dropped went round towards Ravana, brother of Vaisravana, like the bright garland of stars move towards mount Meru.
The gemstudded anklet of Sita, looking like an orb of lightning, dropped with a gentle sound.
With her golden girdle, Sita whose complexion resembled tender leaves looked like a golden chain to bind an elephant with. (Here Ravana is the elephant).
The younger brother of Vaisravana (Ravana), like a massive comet, carried Sita, who was glowing in the radiance of her own beauty, and entered the sky.
Like the dim stars falling from the sky, her ornaments, bright as flame, scattered on the groundtinkling.
Sita's necklace shining like the bright Moon slipped from between her breasts like the river Ganga falling down from the sky.
The trees filled with birds of all kinds, shaken at the top by stormy winds seemed to be saying to Sita, 'Be not afraid'.
Lotusponds with withering lotuses and with disturbed aquatic life like fishes in fright were as if grieving for Sita as one would grieve for a companion who is unable to breathe.
Then the lions, tigers, deer and birds gathered together in anger (also anguish) and ran after Sita's shadow.
The  mountains were  shedding tears in the form of waterfalls, and  crying with hands lifted up in the form of peaks, while Sita was being carried away.
Seeing Sita abducted, the glorious Sun looked lustreless and distraught. He developed a pale white disk around him.
When Rama's consort, the princess of Videha, is being carried away by Ravana, how can there be rightousness or truth or uprightness or compassion for men? Thus bewailed all beings in groups.
The young deer full of fear and distress looked again and again with eyes blurred with tears at the direction in which Sita went. And wept.
The  sylvan deities shivered, seeing Sita's grief and cried aloud.
The ten headed Ravana abducted Sita who was calling out, O Rama, O Lakshmana with her sweet voice, weeping , looking down on the earth her hair dishevelled and auspicious, (vermilion) mark on the forehead erased. Ravana abducted this highminded Sita for his own destruction.
Then Sita  whose teeth were  beautiful and smile, sweet was distanced from her kins, and, unable to see both Rama and Lakshmana, grew pale in intense fear.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Sita, daughter of Janaka, princess of Mithila felt miserable, looking at Ravana taking off and got very  much agitated out of fear.
While being carried away, Sita wept piteously and her eyes went red with tears of anger and grief. Looking at the frightening eyes of the king of the demons, she said these words :
O mean Ravana, are you not ashamed of kidnapping me when I was separated (from my husband)?
O wicked fellow, with an intention to abduct me you enticed my husband to a distance deceitfully in the form of a deer.
This Jatayu, an old friend of my fatherinlaw tried to protect me but he too has fallen a prey.
O lowly demon, you have, indeed, shown your heroism  (in killing this old vulture). You have not won me in a battle declared by you.
O lowly fellow how is it that you are not ashamed of commiting such a despicable act  abducting another's wife when she is alone ?
You consider yourself to be brave after committing such a cruel, despicable and unrighteous act for which people of the world will condemn you.
Fie upon your heroism and strength about which you boasted. Fie upon your character that would bring calumny to the race and the world. I condemn such behaviour of yours.
Tarry a little, you will not go back with life. What can be done now since you are running away so swiftly?
If you come within sight of these two princes, it will not be possible for you to live for a moment even if you are with your entire army.
Just as a bird cannot bear the touch of forest fire, you will not be able to endure the mere touch of arrows of the two heroes indeed.
O Ravana be good and do whatever is beneficial to you. It is proper for you to release me. If you do not, enraged over my assault, my husband along with his brother, will bring about your destruction.
O vile creature, the effort you are making to abduct me forcibly will be fruitless.
I will not be eager to hold on to my life for long to live at the mercy of the enemy without being able to see my godlike husband.
At the time of death, mortals behave very differently. They act contrary to their own welfare. Likewise you are not able to foresee what is beneficial and good for you.
Those who wish to die, do not like anything salutary. I see the noose of death wound round your neck now.
O tenheaded Ravana, since you do not fear the source of fear, evidently you see golden trees. (a symptom of death).
O Ravana, you see the dreadful river Vaitarani with torrents of blood flowing and frightening forest of trees with swords as leaves.
You will see a log of salmali tree with bright golden flowers and excellent vaidurya stone with pointed iron thorns.
You are pitiless. You will not be able to survive for long after deceiving such noble Rama just as man cannot survive after drinking poison.
O Ravana you are bound by the inevitable noose of death. Where shall you get away from great Rama, my husband to obtain peace.
Rama has killed fourteen thousand demons alone without his brother within a moment. He is a strong warrior and wellversed in the use of all kinds of weapons. You have stolen his loving wife. How can he live without killing you.
Sita, daughter of Videha, full of sorrow and fear under Ravana's grip uttered these partly harsh and partly piteous wordsweeping.
Sinful Ravana carried away the beautiful princess trembling with great fear, struggling helplessly, crying pathetically and pleading in many mournful ways.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While Sita was being kidnapped, she saw no one to protect her. Only five great monkeys stood on the top of a mountain.
Largeeyed, bright and beautiful Sita dropped her upper silk garment shining like gold and auspicious ornaments in their midst with a hope they may report this  to Rama.
In his excitement Ravana failed to notice when Sita dropped down that garment along with ornaments in their midst.
The best among the tawneyeyed monkeys gazed, without blinking, at the  largeeyed Sita lamenting.
Ravana crossed the lake Pampa and flew towards the city of Lanka carrying with him lamenting daughter of Videha.
Delighted Ravana, carried off Sita, the very embodiment of his death, like one carrying a highly poisonous sharpfanged female snake on his lap.
Like an arrow released from the bow, Ravana went through the sky, at once crossing forests, rivers mountains and tanks.
Ravana soon crossed the refuge of rivers, the abode of Varuna, god of the sea, inexhaustible ocean, and the home for whales and crocodiles.
While Sita, princess of Videha was being carried away, the ocean, abode of Varuna  got bewildered, waves rolled back, the movement of big serpents and fishes stopped.
The charanas and siddhas moving in the sky said, O tenheaded Ravana this is your  end .
Ravana entered the city of Lanka holding Sita who was tossing from side to side and who was the very embodiment of his death.
Ravana went through the well laidout roads of the city of Lanka and through the well many guarded halls of the palace and entered the inner apartment.
Sita, with her dark eye lashes and lost in utter sorrow was kept in the harem by Ravana, like demon Maya kept Mayamayi.
Ravana ordered the female goblins of fearful appearance,'Let no outsider whether man or woman, see her, without my permission'.
Pearls, gems or gold, clothes or ornaments, whatever she desires, be made available to her without any hesitation.
Whoever utters any unpleasant words knowingly or unknowingly to Sita, princess of Videha is not worthy to survive (must be killed).
The courageous lord of the demons, having said so to the demonesses, came out of the inner apartment. While contemplating the future course of action, he saw eight powerful, carnivorous demons.
The mighty Ravana, deluded by the boons, praised the strength and valour of the demons and said :
Armed with different weapons, proceed at once to Janasthana where Khara lived and died.
Go and there in the desolate Janasthana where all demons had been killed, leaving all your apprehensions and relying on your strength and vigour.
I had stationed a great army at Janasthana, who were all killed along with Khara and Dusana by Rama's arrows.
My anger engineered by my intolerance has crossed the limits of my patience. It has created in me a terrific enmity against Rama.
I want to take revenge on my foe. I shall not sleep until I kill him in a combat.
I will be happy only after killing the destroyer of Khara and Dusana, just as a poor man feels happy only on acquiring wealth.
While dwelling at Janasthana, all of you should collect exact information about the activities of Rama.
All of you, O nightrangers, should be on the alert there and it should be always your duty to try to kill Rama.
I have seen your strength on many war fronts. That is why you have been assigned this  duty at Janasthana.
The eight demons were glad to hear the pleasing and meaningful words of Ravana. They offered him salutations and left Lanka in the direction of Janasthana without being seen by any one.
Then the demon Ravana felt greatly happy for getting Sita, princess of Mithila, without knowing in his delusion that he had created the bitterest enmity with Rama.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वामलीकीये आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुःपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
After ordering the eight most fierce  and powerful demons, Ravana had a sense of accomplishment within himself because of his perverse intellect.
Thinking about Vaidehi and hit by the arrows of Cupid (the god of love). Ravana hastened to see Sita and entered the beautiful home.
Ravana, lord of the demons, entered his residence and saw Sita full of grief in the midst of the demonesses.
The demon Ravana forcibly took Sita, her face full of tears, to show her his heavenlike home. Inflicted with grief she looked wretched. She resembled a female deer hounded out of the herd. With her head bent in grief, she looked pathetic like one not under her control, like a boat sinking under the sea driven by the wind.
His home was a complex of palaces and mansions served by thousands of women. It was an abode of different flocks of birds. It had captivating pillars studded with gold, crystals, silver, diamonds and vaiduryas. It resounded with wonderful sounds of drums. Its golden entrances were glittering.
He ascended the wonderful golden staircase taking Sita along with him.Beautiful looked the rows of mansions with silver and ivory windows and golden trellis.
The tenheaded Ravana showed Sita, the princess from Mithila the floors with wonderful crystals.
Ravana showed Sita who was overwhelmed with sorrow, stepwells surrrounded by various trees and tanks.
The sinful Ravana showed Sita, princess of Videha, the best of all his mansions in order to allure her, saying:
O Sita, leaving aside children and the aged, I am the lord of crores of nightrangers in addition to ten crore demons and twentytwo crore terrorists.
For me alone there are a thousand attendants.The  administration of the kingdom and all my subjects will be under your control. O largeeyed Sita you are dearer to me than my life.
O Sita dear  be my chief queen among the many thousands of women I have married.
Do not think otherwise. Be good and accept my request. I am consumed by thoughts of you. You should be gracious to me.
This Lanka extending to a hundred yojanas and surrounded by the sea is vulnerable to neither demons nor gods including Indra.
I do not see any one equal to me in valour among gods, or yakshas or gandharvas or birds.
Of what use is Rama who has lost his kingdom, who is depressed and leads an ascetic life and who is a shortlived, lacklustre human being.
O Sita take refuge only in me. I am a befitting husband to you. O timid one youth is impermanent. Enjoy (your life) with me while it lasts.
O lovely Sita, give up the thought of seeing Rama. Where does he possess the power to reach this place even on the mental plane ?
It is not possible to bind  the wind blowing at high speed in the sky. Similarly it is not possible to catch the brilliant glow of flaming fire.
O lovely lady, I do not see any one in these three worlds who can, by his valour, take you away from me guarded by my arms.
Rule this vast kingdom of Lanka. People like me, even gods and all beings, mobile and immobile, will be at your beck and call.
Drenched with the waters of consecration, entertain me. The effect of the bad deeds done in the past are over with your dwelling in the forest. Now enjoy the fruits  of your  good and righteous deeds here with me.
O princess from Mithila, put on all garlands of wonderful fragrance and finest of jewels here with me.
O finehipped lady, I won by my strength from my brother Vaisravana (Kubera) an aerial chariot called Pushpaka shining with the radiance of the Sun.
O Sita that excellent chariot is big and beautiful. Where on you can roam happily along with me.
O heavyhipped lady your face which is a clean lotus pleasing to the eye has lost its shine, stricken with grief.
As Ravana went on speaking thus, Sita covered her beautiful, moonlike face with the edge of her garment and stood shedding tears.
While Sita was lost in thought, feeling ill at lase, looking wretched with her beauty dulled by her anxiety, the sinful lord of the demons continued :
I am bowing down, pressing my heads at your shining feet. I am at your mercy. Grant me your favourI will remain your slave and remain ever under your control.
My throat has dried up. I have spoken these words in a forlorn state. Ravana has never bowed down to a woman in obeisance.
Having said this to the daughter of Janaka, the tenheaded Ravana who had fallen under the control of Yama, lord of death, misconceived that she had become his own.इतयार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thus addressed by Ravana, Sita, immersed in deep sorrow and unafraid of him, placed  a blade of grass between her and him (intending not to speak to him  straight) and replied:
Rama is a son of  the renowned king Dasaratha, who was a firm ambankment (protector) of righteousness and was true to his promise.
The longarmed, largeeyed Rama is famous in all the three worlds. He is my husband, a righteous soul and a god to all.
The brilliant Rama of the Ikshvaku dynasty with the lion's shoulders will come with his brother Lakshmana and take away your life.
Had you abducted me forcibly in his presence, you would have been lying down dead just as Khara in Janasthana.
Those dreadful, mighty demons you have described are ineffective in his presence just like the serpents who with their venom are ineffective  in the presence of  Suparna (Garuda).
The goldtipped arrows released from his bowstring will shatter your body like the waves erode the banks of river Ganga.
O Ravana, even if you stand invulnerable to gods and demons, you will not come out alive in the combat with Rama with whom you have earned great enmity.
Powerful Rama will put an end to whatever little life you are left with. Just as a beast tied to a sacrificial post, you will not  survive.
O demon, you will be completely consumed if Rama looks at you with eyes burning in anger.
He who can bring down the Moon to the earth from the sky or even dash it down, he who can drain the sea dry will definitely release me from here.
Your life is coming to an end. Your fortunes will wane, your strength will be sapped. Your senses will be dissipated. By your deeds Lanka will attain widowhood.
This evil deed(of abduction) will not yield happy results.You have brought me from my husband from the forest without any forethought.
My effulgent, valiant husband armed with divine power resides fearlessly in the desolate Dandaka.
He will remove your pride, your power, your valour and haughtiness from your limbs with a shower of arrows in the fight.
When destruction draws near, people being prompted by time start commiting blunders in their deeds.
You vilest of demons, since you have assaulted me, the time of your death and destruction of all demons and of all women in the harem has drawn near.
The sacrificial altar adorned with ladles and vessels and sanctified by the sacred mantras recited by brahmins cannot be defiled by a chandala (man of lowest caste).
O lowly demon  similarly I am a chaste woman and wife of the ever righteous Rama who cannot be defiled by a sinner like you.
How can a female swan ever sporting in lotusponds in the company of a royal swan look at the watercrow resting on a grassy land?
O demon  this body has (now) no consciousness. You may bind it or bury it. I do not think that this body or even this life need to be protected. But at no cost can I make this an object of censure on earth (must not be branded an unchaste woman).
Having uttered these very harsh words out of anger, the daughter of Videha, the princess from Mithila spoke no more.
Having heard such harsh, horripilating words from Sita, Ravana replied in a way designed to create fear in her:
O comely princess from Mithila, O lady with a sweet smile listen to my words. If you do not accept my hand in the course of twelve months, the cooks will cut you off into small bits for the (my) breakfast.
Enraged Ravana, who used to make enemies wail, turned to the demonesses and said these words.
Addressing the flesheating, blooddrinking, loathsome and fearful demonesses Ravana said, Humble her pride at once.
No sooner had Ravana said it than the dreadful demonesses offered obeisance to him with folded hands and surrounded Sita.
Stamping his feet and shaking the ground as if tearing the earth, Ravana said to those fiercelooking demonesses:
Let this Sita be led into the Asoka grove. There sit round her and protect her in secret (her presence there should not be made public).
There you all bring her under control through forcing and cajoling as one would do to tame a wild sheelephant.
Thus instructed by Ravana, the demonesses took Sita into the Asoka grove, which was full of perenmal fruits and flowers of different kinds, where trees yielded fruits of all seasons and birds were always cheerful.
Sita, daughter of Janaka, engulfed in grief found herself like a doe under the control of tigresses.
Sita, daughter of Janaka, immersed in deep grief knew no peace just like a doe caught in a snare.
Sita had no peace as she was threatened excessively by those women of deformed  looks. Remembering her beloved husband who was also her god, and overtaken by fear and grief , she fell unconscious.इतयार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षटपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama killed Maricha, the demon assuming the form of the deer as per his will and swiftly took the return path.
While Rama was hasting to see Sita, he heard from behind the ghastly howl of a jackal.
Rama knew it was the horrible, horripilating cry of a jackal which made him apprehensive . It made him think.
'The way the jackal is howling appears ominous. May Sita be safe without being eaten up by demons
'If  Lakshmana listens to Maricha imitating my voice in the form of a deer, he, sent by Sita will come for me at once, leaving her behind.
'Hence the murder of Sita must have been jointly planned by the demons. Maricha who had assumed the form of a golden deer, took me away from the hermitage to a faroff place where, killed by my arrows, he turned a demon uttering the words, Alas, Lakshmana, I am killed.
'On account of living in this dense forest in Janasthana I have earned enmity with the demons. Will Lakshmana and Sita be safe without my protection? I see many terrible portents.'
On hearing the jackal's howl, Rama began thinking how the demon in the form of a deer drew him away. Thus in the midst of apprehensions he reached Janasthana.
Dejected at heart, the birds and animals piteously kept the great soul (Rama) to the left and produced a dreadful cacophony.
On seeing such dreadfu omens at that time, Rama hurried back to his hermitage.
Rama arrived at Janasthana thinking (of the safety) of charming Sita and mighty Lakshmana.
He then saw Lakshmana coming towards him with a cheerless face. When the sad, depressed Lakshmana came near, he saw Rama (equally) despondent and griefstricken.
In this situation Rama the elder brother rebuked Lakshmana for having left Sita behind in a desolate forest infested with demons.
Rama, the delight of the Raghus, took hold of Lakshmana's left hand, and in sadness said these sweet harsh words :
O gentle Lakshmana you are to blame for coming here, leaving Sita behind. Alas will she be safe now?
O heroic Lakshmana I see many inauspicious omens. I think Sita might have been lost or eaten away by the demons of the forest. There is no doubt about it.
O Lakshmana, a tiger among men, will we be able to see the daughter of Janaka, living in a state of total wellbeing? Will we be able to get her back ?
O  mighty Lakshmana  from the way the beasts, jackals and birds too have turned in the bright direction of the Sun, crying in a frightful manner, can we hope princess Sita is safe ?
Appearing in the guise of a deer, this demon allured me to a great distance. With much effort he was somehow killed. but he assumed his demoniac form while dying.
With my heart dejected and depressed, my left eye throbbing, O Lakshmana, I have no doubt that Sita is either abducted or dead or abandoned on the way.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, son of Dasaratha, the righteous self, saw Lakshmana downcast and dejected. Seeing him  without Sita, Rama enquired:
Where is that princess from Videha who accompanied me when I entered Dandaka forest ? Why have you come here leaving her behind ?
Where is that princess from Videha, a sharer of my sorrows, Sita of slender waist who followed this hapless prince disloged from the kingdom into the Dandaka forest?
O warrior Lakshmana where is that Sita without whom I have no interest to live for a moment, who was like the daughter of a god and a sustainer of my life?
O Lakshmana I desire no lordship of the gods  or of the entire earth without that daughter of Janaka, that lady of golden complexion.
O gentle Lakshmana I wonder if Vaidehi, who is dearer to me than my life is still alive I hope my banishment from the kingdom is not going to prove false.
O Saumitri when I am dead on account of Sita, and you are back, Kaikeyi with her desire fulfilled will be happy, indeed.
O handsome one  I wonder if that lady of renunciation, Kausalya with her son dead, will have to serve Kaikeyi whose desire would be fulfilled, and who will enjoy the power of the throne in the company of her son
O Lakshmana, only if Vaidehi is alive will I enter the cottage again or else I will give up my life if that virtuous lady is no more.
I will die if Sita, princess from Videha, is not there to speak to me with her sweet smile when I return to the cottage, O Lakshmana
Tell me, O Lakshmana   if Sita is alive or not, whether she was eaten up by demons when you were off your guard.
Vaidehi is delicate, young and she has never faced any sorrow.She will be certainly disheartened due to separation from me.
The evilminded, wicked demon calling out loudly 'O Lakshmana' must have by all means instilled fear in your mind.
I am afraid, Vaidehi, frightened by hearing the voice which was like mine sent you to see me, and you came all at once.
You have definitely done a great mistake by leaving Sita alone in the forest. This has given a chance to the cruel demons to wreak revenge.
The dreadful, carnivorous demons aggrieved over my murder of Khara must have undoubtedly killed Sita.
O destroyer of enemies  I am completely drowned in sorrow. What can I do at this moment. Alas, I am destined to suffer.
While thus brooding over the beautiful Sita, the scion of the Raghus along with Lakshmana hurried towards Janasthana.
Thus blaming his dejected brother, the valiant Rama entered the hermitage, sighing deeply, his face pale and his throat dried up with hunger, exhaustion and thirst. Reaching his dwellingplace, he found it empty. He thoroughly searched the hermitage and the places where she used to move about on the premises. And 'so it has happened', he sadly said to himself, his hair raised on end.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, the delight of the Raghus, once again questioned Lakshmana who had come out of the hermitage, deeply hurt:
Why did you come, leaving the princess from Mithila alone in the forest when I had left her under your trust ?
When I saw you, O Lakshmana, coming without Sita, my mind was oppressed with evil thought which have come true.
O Lakshmana, as I saw you from a distance without Sita, my left eye, my shoulder and my heart throbbed.
Thus addressed, virtuous Lakshmana, overwhelmed with sorrow replied to the grief stricken Rama:
I did not leave her on my own nor have I  come here of my own accord. I came to you, provoked by her angry  words.
Uttered loudly, 'Alas Sita, Alas, Lakshmana, save me', as if these were the words of your noble self, reached Sita's ears.
The princess from Mithila heard this cry of pain and, wild with fear, urged me out of her love for you to go.
When I was repeated asked to go, I said this in order to instil confidence in the princess from Mithila :
'No one  can cause fear in Rama. I do not see any demon who can hold a threat to him. Give up fear. Some one might have said it.
'How can Rama who is capable of saving even gods speak such unworthy, demeaning words, 'Save me, O Sita'
O fair lady, for some reason some demon  has uttered these words 'Save me, save me' adapting my brother's voice.
'Lakshmana, save me' are the words uttered in an altered tone. Like an ordinary, lowborn woman you are not to feel concerned for this.
'You should not feel agitated or dispirited. Be composed. There is no one either born or going to be born in the three worlds who can defeat Rama in war. He cannot be conquered in a battle even by gods led by indra.'
Deluded by her senses, Vaidehi said these words, shedding tears when I  tried to console  her:
'You have an extremely sinful intention of getting me  when your brother is dead. But you will not be able to gain me.
'Since you are not reaching out to Rama who is helplessly crying for his rescue, you must have followed Rama, instructed by Bharata (to do him harm)'৷৷
'You are an enemy moving in disguise with an interest in me. You are waiting for an opportunity to set aside Rama. That is why you are not rushing to him.'
At these words from the princess of Videha, I came out of the hermitage in an agitated mood with my eyes turned red and lips quivering in anger.
To Lakshmana thus reporting, Rama, overcome with grief, said,(Even then) O noble brother your coming here, leaving her behind, is a wrong step taken.
You have come out of the hermitage provoked by Maithili's angry words, even though you are aware that I am capable of warding off the demons.
I am not happy with you as you have come here deserting Sita on the plea that she was angry and spoke harsh words.
Provoked by the words of Sita spoken in anger you came without respecting my orders. It is definitely an act of disobedience.
This demon who misled me in the guise of a deer and took me away from the hermitage, lies dead, killed by my arrow.
Bending the bow I fixed the arrow and released it at ease. Hit by that arrow he gave up his guise of the deer and assuming the form of a demon with a bracelet on his arm fell down groaning.
Hit by the arrow, the demon imitating my voice cried out in desperation which could be clearly audible even from a distance. On hearing the dreadful words you deserted Sita and came here.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
As  Rama was returning( to the hermitage), his left eye throbbed repeatedly  and he stumbled and his body trembled.
As inauspicious omens appeared again and again, doubting if all is well with Sita, he said to himself, Can Sita be safe?
Anxious to see Sita, he hastened to the hermitage and finding it empty, became restless.
Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, hurtled in, turning round, throwing his hands to and fro, casting his looks all around the cottage where she used to move. The cottage, devoid of Sita looked like a lotuspond, the beauty of its lotuses destroyed by winter.
The trees with flowers withered, the animals and birds turned pale looked as if they were weeping. Bereft of their beauty they wore a ruinous look. The sylvan deities had left.  The deerskin and kusa grass were strewn here and there, the grass cushions and straw mats lay scattered. Seeing his cottage so desolate Rama wept again and again.
'Timid Sita might have been abducted or dead or crushed or eaten up by demons. Or, she may be hiding for protection in the forest'
'Maybe she has gone to pluck flowers or fruits. Or to the lotuspond or river to  fetch water.'
He ransacked the forest, yet did not find his beloved. He  appeared like a mad man, his eyes turned red with tears of sorrow.
Running from tree to tree, hill to hill, and river to river and weeping, Rama was immersed in a sea of sorrow.
O Kadamba tree, tell me if you have seen my beloved with a fair face and with love for kadamba flowers.
O Bilva tree, tell me if you have seen a lady delicate like your tender leaf, dressed in yellow silk, a lady whose breasts are round like Bilva fruits.
O Arjuna tree, tell me if you know a timid lady, daughter of Janaka and my beloved, fond of Arjuna tree. Is the living or not ?
This Kakubha tree rich with tender leaves and flowers (perhaps)knows Maithili whose thighs are beautiful like the trunk of the Kakubha tree.
This great Tilaka tree round which bees bumble surely knows the lady who loves to put tilaka marks on the forehead.
O Ashoka tree, dispeller of sorrow, by quickly showing me my darling make me ashoka (free from sorrow) as I am griefstricken at heart.
O Palmyra tree be kind to me and tell me if you have seen my beautiful beloved who has breasts like ripe palmyra fruit?
O Jambu tree, do not hesitate to tell me if you know Sita whose body shines lovely like gold.
O Karnikara tree with flowers in full bloom, tell me if you have seen my faithful beloved who is fond of karnikara flowers.
Renowned Rama, like a madman confused, approached the Mango, Kadamba , Sal and Jackfruit, Dhava, Champak, Ketaki trees and Pomegranate, Jasmine and Madhavi creepers, in order to make similar queries.
Or,  O deer do you know about Maithili who has the eyes of a fawn? My beloved who has the restless eyes of a doe may be found in their company.
O elephant tell me if you have seen her whose thighs are like the trunk of an elephant. O best of elephants, tell me if you know her.
O tiger tell me freely and fearlessly if you have seen my beloved princess from Mithila with a face like the moon.
O lotus eyed darling, why are you running away? I have already seen you.  Why are you hiding behind trees and not replying to me?
O my beautiful beloved, stay, stay  Have you no compassion for me ? You are so fond of fun. Why do you avoid me?
O lady of lovely complexion, I can see your yellow silk (flying), while you are running away. If you have love for me, stay on.
O lady with a sweet smile I have never hurt you. When I am in difficulty it does not behove you to ignore me.
It is clear that separated from me, the body of my young beloved is torn off and eaten away by carnivorous demons.
Her beautiful face with her sparkling teeth and lips, wellshaped nose, shining earrings has been like the full moon, eclipsed and rendered pale.
That delicate, beautiful neck of my beloved having the complexion of a champak flower and adorned with necklaces was perhaps eaten up.
Her arms, delicate like tender leaves, their tips (fingers) quivering, adorned with armlets and bracelets have surely been eaten away.
The young lady having many relations, forsaken by me, has been (perhaps) picked up by a demon for food and later abandoned halfeaten.
O longarmed Lakshmana, are you able to see my beloved anywhere? O noble lady, O darling, where have you gone? O Sita  SIta
Rama ran from forest to forest, now jumping, now taking strong strides, but all the time weeping, a madman busy in search of his beloved.
He rushed through forests, rivers, hills and mountain streams and through dense jungles with an unstable mind.
Rama went about the vast forest searching for the princess from Mithila all over not giving up hope of finding her. He continued to make great efforts for searching his beloved.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama, son of Dasaratha, saw the empty cottage devoid of Sita. The mats were displaced. He searched everywhere but unable to see Vaidehi lifted his lovely arms and said:
O son of Sumitra, where is my beloved ? Where did she go? By whom was she abducted? Or, devoured? O Lakshmana
O Sita if you intend to make fun by hiding behind a tree, I tell you it is enough. Stop it and come to this extremely sorrowful man.
O gentle  Sita those fawns who trusted you and played with you, are now separated from you. Brooding over you, their eyes are brimming with tears.
O Lakshmana, I cannot live without Sita. I am filled with deep grief on account of Sita's abduction. My late father, the king will certainly see me in the other world (I will definitely commit suicide).
My father say will surely in the other world: Without completing the appointed period of the vow taken, how could you come here ? Fie upon you  You are irresponsible. You are ignoble. You are a liar.
O lovely lady where have you gone, leaving me here like fame deserting a crook? I am helpless griefstricken, pitiable, pathetic and disappointed. O lady of slender waist, leave me not. Separated from you, I will give up my life.
Deeply distressed, Rama who was anxious to see Sita, daughter of Janaka, wailed and wailed but could not see her.
Lakshmana, dedicated to his wellbeing, spoke to Rama, son of Dasaratha, who was sinking like an elephant into the quagmire, when he failed to trace Sita.
O longarmed, heroic Rama, do not grieve. This forest is full of caves. Let us try together.
Sita is madly in love with the forest. She might have entered deep into the jungle or into a fully blossomed lotuspond.
Maybe she has gone to take a dip in the river full of reeds and fishes  Or has hidden somewhere for the sake of fun.
O best of men, maybe Vaidehi has hidden in the forest intending to scare you and me. She wishes to test our love. O blessed Rama let us ransack the forest immediately.
O scion of the Kakutsthas, let us search all over the forest if you please. Do not indulge in sorrow.
When Lakshmana consoled him so affectionately Rama became composed. He continued the search with Lakshmana, son of Sumitra.
The two sons of Dasaratha went on searching for Sita in forests, mountains, rivers, ponds everywhere.
They were not able to find Sita even though they searched all over the mountain slopes, caves and peaks.
After searching her all over, Rama said  Saumitri, I am unable to find the noble Vaidehi on the mountain
Going about the Dandaka forest Lakshmana, consumed by sorrow, said  to his brother, glowing with brilliance:
O longarmed brother O wise sire  just as Visnu obtained the earth by binding Bali you will obtain Sita certainly.
Having been addressed thus by Lakshmana, Raghava with a griefstriken heart said these piteous words :'Lakshmana,having  spoken like that very affectionately to Rama,who was disturbed by excessive grief said these words piteously:
O wise Lakshmana I have searched the entire forest, the ponds with fully blossomed lotuses, the mountains with many caves and streams. But could not see Vaidehi who is dearer to me than my life.
Thus tormented by the abduction of Sita, Rama felt dejected and cried.Overpowered by grief he lost his consciousness for a moment.
By grief tormented, limbs enervated, intellect atrophied, senses switched off, he felt anxious and depressed and sighed long and hot.
Rama, his throat choked, shed propuse tears, sighing, O my darling.
Then Lakshmana, the knower of dharma and a dear friend offered obeisance most humbly with folded palms and consoled Rama in many ways.
Without caring  for the words from the lips of Lakshmana, Rama sobbed loudly, unable to see his beloved Sita.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The righteous, the longarmed,lotuseyed Rama, unable to see Sita wept with his senses overwhilmed by grief.
Under the spell of Cupid, Rama uttered such words in grief which are otherwise unutterable. As if he was seeing Sita (before him) which was not a fact.
O my beloved  as you love flowers you are hiding your body behind the branches of the Ashoke tree that enhances my sorrow (paradoxically).
O Devi I can see both your thighs which resemble banana trunk hidden behind a banana plant. It is not possible for you to hide them from me.
O gentle one  you are wandering in the karnikara garden, laughing and making fun. Enough of this , that causes my pain.
O my dear Sita, why are you joking when I am exhausted? Such fun cannot be relished  now.
O darling  joking specially in a hermitage  is not appreciated. I know your nature.You love fun. O largeeyed Sita, come here. This cottage of yours is empty.
O Lakshmana surely Sita is either devoured by demons or abducted. When I am weeping like this she is not coming to me.
O Lakshmana, these herds of deer with their eyes filled with tears are as if telling me that she is eaten away by the demons.
Alas, my noble lady, where have you gone? O chaste lady of excellent complexion, that queen Kaikeyi's desire will be fulfilled now.
I left home with Sita. How can I reenter the inner apartment without her ?
By Sita's abduction it will be  clear to the world that I lack manliness and compassion. My cowardly nature will clearly manifest.
After completing the period of my exile when Janaka , king of Mithila, enquires of her welfare how can I face him?
If the king of Videha sees me without her, he will surely be distressed and will fall into a swoon for the love of his daughter.
Or else, I will not go to the city ruled by Bharata. Without Sita even heaven will be empty for me.
Go to the auspicious city of Ayodhya, leaving me here in the woods. I can never live without Sita.
While embracing Bharata tightly, repeat my words, 'You are permitted by Rama to rule the earth.'
My mother Kaikeyi, Sumitra and Kausalya  should also be offered due obeisance. You should protect them with great effort, carrying out my instructions.
O Lakshmana, subduer of the enemy this loss of Sita and me should be explained in detail to my mother.
When Rama, devoid of  Sita, the lady with beautiful hair, wailed piteously after reaching the forest, Lakshmana too, his face pale out of fear and mind dejected, felt extremely agitated.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Prince Rama, separated from his beloved, lost his senses out of sorrow. Seeing his brother in a distressed state, he sank again into intense grief.
Plunged in deep grief, Rama heaved hot sighs and said these words to griefstricken Lakshmanaweeping:
I think there is none on earth like me who has performed such forbidden acts.  One grief after the other is successively piercing my heart and my mind.
In the past I had certainly done some sinful deeds I often liked the consequences of which have descended on me now as I am experiencing one sorrow after another.
O Lakshmana, loss of kingdom, separation from kith and kin, death of father, separation from mother--all these thoughts augment my sorrow faster and in greater measure.
O Lakshmana, all this sorrow calmed down when I came to this solitary forest. But with Sita's separation, it was rekindled just as fire blazes forth again with logs of wood.
The timid princess of mine forcibly carried away into the sky by a demon must have again and again cried aloud out of fear in a broken voice.
Her captivating copper coloured skin, smeared with the best of red sandal paste would not be surely pleasing now, drenched in blood and mud.
Her face with her clear, sweet and gentle words and her curly hair falling will no more look bright coming under the grip of demons like the moon eclipsed by Rahu.
The bloodthirsty demons must have drunk the blood of my faithful beloved in a lonely place breaking her neck that used to wear beautiful necklaces.
The lovely, largeeyed lady separated from me in the desolate forest, abducted and dragged by demons must have cried at that time desperately like a female osprey.
On this rock, O Lakshmana, my goodnatured lady with her lovely smile sat with me in the past and chatted with you.
Would she have gone to Godavari, the foremost of the rivers so dear at all times to my beloved ? But I think she has not gone there alone at any time.
The lady whose face was like the lotus, whose large eyes were like lotus petals could  have gone to fetch lotuses (but) that also is not possible as she has never gone there without me.
Could she have gone to the forest where there are many kinds of trees in full bloom inhabited by a variety of birds? That is also not possible as she is timid and too scared to go there alone.
O Sungod, you know all the happenings of the world. You are witness to all the deeds of the people, true and false. Tell me where my beloved Sita has gone or has been carried off. My grief never ceases.
O Windgod, there is nothing that you know not in all the worlds. Do tell me if  that lady of a noble race has been abducted or dead or is on the way.
While Rama was thus in tears, in a state of sorrow and swoon, Lakshmana who was rational and courageous spoke to him words appropriate to the time :
O noble prince, give up grief. Take courage. Show enthusiasm to search and find Sita. Enthusiastic people will not get despondent in carrying out the  most difficult tasks.
Rama who carries on the (glorious) progeny of the Raghu dynasty, did not (however) consider seriously the words of Lakshmana, a man of great prowess. Forsaking his courage he was once again overtaken by deep sorrow.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama in dejection said these pitiable words to Lakshmana,O Lakashmana, go swiftly to the river Godavari and find out if Sita has gone there to get lotuses.
Lakshmana, destroyer of enemywarriors, went to the beautiful river Godavari with quick steps following the instruction of Rama.
Searching for Sita at the landings of river Godavari, Lakshmana said to Rama, I am unable to find her at these landings.No one responds to my call.
Where could Vaidehi, destroyer of sorrow, go? I wonder. I am unable to trace the spot where the daughter of Janaka could be found.
Overwhelmed with grief on hearing Lakshmana's words, Rama himself went to river Godavari, and shouted, where are you, Sita?
Like the elements of Nature, river Godavari did not disclose Rama that Sita had been abducted by the king of demons who deserved death.
River Godavari (although) prompted by creatures (of Nature) to tell him about his beloved did not respond to brooding Rama.
Remembering the evilminded Ravana's appearance and action, the river revealed nothing about Vaidehi out of fear.
Disappointed by the river and emaciated by not being able to see Sita, Rama said to Lakshmana :
O handsome Lakshmana this Godavari does not at all respond. How can I go to Janaka and my mother without Sita and break this unhappy news?
Where could have gone that Vaidehi, who  removed all my sorrows and sufferings when I lost my kingdom and survived on food available in the forest?
Away from relatives and away from the princess, I keep awake during nights which seem too long.
I will roam about the river Godavari, Janasthana and this mount Prasravana till I find Sita.
O mighty Lakshmana these deer are looking at me again and again indicating that they wish to tell me something.
With his vision blurred by tears, Rama, the best among men, looked at them and asked them 'Where is Sita'?
Thus asked by the prince, all the deer got up suddenly, and pointed towards the southern sky, the direction in which the princess from Mithila was carried off. Looking at the Lord of men (Rama), they started running in that direction.
Even Lakshmana marked that the deer were showing and looking at the path lying in that direction.
Observing intelligently their indications and understanding the meaning of their message, Lakshmana said to his distressed elder brother:
O lord these deer are indicating the land on the southern side.Therefore it will be proper for both of us to proceed in the southwestern direction. Maybe we will get some clue or find that noble Sita.
Handsome Rama said, 'yes'and started in southern direction, carefully looking at the ground, followed by Lakshmana.
Talking with each other, the two brothers took the path on earth strewn with flowers.
Seeing showers of flowers fallen on the ground, valiant Rama sadly said these words to sorrowful Lakshmana:
O Lakshmana, here are the same flowers I had given Vaidehi to wear in the forest. I can recognize them.
I think the Sun, the wind  and the famed earth have done me a favour by preserving these flowers.
Rigteous Rama, the best among men, having said these words to the longarmed Lakshmana, asked mount Prasravana, full of streams:
O king of the mountains have you seen a lady with beautiful limbs separated from me in this forest tract ?
Like a lion aiming at a petty animal, angry Rama  said, O Mountain before I destroy  all your slopes show me that goldenhued Sita with lustre like gold.
Thus addressed by Rama, the mountain echoed as if it was telling about Sita but did not show her to Rama.
Rama, Dasaratha's son said to the mountain, The fire of my arrows will reduce you to ashes.You will have no grass, no tree, no twig. You will be unfit to be served any more.
O Lakshmana if this river does not tell me about that noble Sita with countenance like the moon, I will drain it dry right now.
While Rama was angry with his eyes burning, he saw on the ground as he advanced large footprints of a demon and then the footprints of Maithili which signified as if chased by the demon, she was frightened and was running hither and thither, longing to see Rama.
Bewildered to see the broken bow and quiver and many splinters of the chariot scattered all over, Rama said to his loving brother Lakshmana:
O Saumitri  see the many broken bits of gold ornaments and garlands.
See, O Lakshmana, the patches of blood looking like drops of shining gold spread all over the ground.
O Lakshmana, Vaidehi might have been cut into pieces, and eaten up by the demons who can assume any form at their free will.
O Lakshmana, two demons might have fought a dreadful duel at this place contesting with each other for the sake of Vaidehi.
O handsome Lakshmana whose is this huge bow embedded with pearls and gems and adorned with gold fallen on the ground?
Whose is this shield of gold studded with Vaidurya, broken and strewn all over the ground, shining like the morning Sun?
Whose parasol is this with a hundred spokes, festooned with wonderful flowers thrown down on the ground with broken staff ?
Whose are these donkeys, with golden chestcoverings, with the devil's face, fierceful and huge and slain in the encounter ?
Whose war chariot with a battle flag is this, shining like burning fire, turned upside down and broken?
Whose are these pointless arrows of the size of a chariot axle adorned with bright gold destroyed and scattered ? Who is he that has performed such terrible deeds?
O Lakshmana  look at these two quivers filled with arrows and lying shattered.  The charioteer is holding a whip and reins in his hands and is lying dead. To whom do they belong?
O best among men, O handsome Lakshmana see these carriers of fans with head dress and earrings studded with gems lying slain in the combat. Whose are they ?
This indeed is the path the man or the demon has traversed. My enmity with him now has become hundredfold. This will end only with the extermination of his life.
O handsome one, those demons can change their form at will and are of dreadful nature. Have they abducted or devoured or killed her in this great forest. Even her righteousness could not protect the helpless Sita.
If Sita has been devoured or kidnapped, none in this world or even gods could do anything to make me happy, O handsome Lakshmana
O Lakshmana even the compassionate and heroic Creator of the worlds will be disrespected by all beings, however ignorantly (if such things are allowed to happen).
The gods will certainly consider me a man engaged in the welfare of the world, a man of selfrestraint and compassion, but at the same time a weak man.
O Lakshmana even demerits turn into merits when they come in contact with me. Just as the Sun shines, effacing the moonlight, my brilliance will outshine my demerits of exterminating all (wicked) beings including the demons.
O Lakshmana, neither yakshas, nor goblins nor demons nor kinneras nor humans  will be in peace now.
O Lakshmana, just see, I will fill the sky with all my weapons and arrows and make all movements impossible in the three worlds.
I will obstruct the movement of planets and the Moon, destroy the radiance of the Sun, the fire and block the wind crush the mountain tops, dry up the tanks, destroy the trees shrubs and creepers and annihilate the oceans. I shall bring about this fatal change at once in the three worlds.
If the gods do not return my Sita safely to me, O Lakshmana  they will witness my power right now.
Lakshmana no beings will be able to move in the sky, blocked by arrows released from my bowstring there will be no space left there.
O Lakshmna now beasts and birds will be confused and destroyed by my darts.You will see them crossing all limits of propriety.
For the sake of Maithili I will render this world devoid of goblins and demons with my irresistible arrows pulled up to my ears.
Now the gods will witness the power of my arrows released in great rage which can hit distant targets.
My anger will destroy all the gods, demons and evil spirits. They will be extinghished from the three worlds.
The worlds of gods, yakshas or even demons torn into shreds by my arrows will not  survive.
If the gods do not hand over Sita to me either carried away or dead I will transgress these worlds, O Lakshmana
If my beloved Vaidehi is not given back to me in her true form I will destroy the three worlds with all animate and inanimate beings.
After speaking these words, handsome Rama, his eyes red with anger, pressed his bow, took out the glowing arrow that was dreadful like a poisonous serpent, fixed it to his bow and said these words in a rage like the fire at the time of dissolution of the world.
Just as all beings in this world cannot avoid age and death, or defy time and fate so also none can prevent me at all when I am  angry, O Lakshmana
I will topsyturvy this entire world including the gods, the gandharvas, human beings, serpents and mountains if they do not show me the princess from Mithila, who is blemishless and whose teeth are beautifulइत्यार्शे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकेय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुष्षष्टिमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Tormented and emaciated due to Sita's abduction, resembling the fire at the time of dissolution of the creation, ready to destroy the world, Rama looked at his bow strung again and again, breathing hot sighs like Lord Siva at the end of the creation, wishing to burn down the world in a rage. Lakshmana who had never seen Rama in such anger before said to him with folded hands and parched throat.
Earlier you were gentle, self restrained and engaged in the welfare of all beings. (Now) it is not proper for you to give up your natural composure in anger.
In you are always present the grace of the Moon, the radiance of the Sun, the motion of the wind, the forbearance of the earth and reputation.
To destroy the world for the mistake of a single person is not proper. Why and by whom is this warchariot broken with weapons and all its accesories I do not know.
O prince, this place is damaged by the hooves of the horses and the rims of the chariot. It is soaked with drops of blood.Very dreadful must have been the fight here.
O, best of the eloquent  this fight involves only one and not two. I do not see the footprints of a big army.
To destroy the entire world for one individual is not right. The lords of the earth should remain gentle, peaceful and punish only the deserving.
You are the ultimate resort and refuge of all beings. Who would like that your wife should be abducted ?
Just as pious men do not do anything disagreeable towards persons who observe religious vows, so also rivers, seas and mountains, gods, gandharvas and demons are not capable of causing unhappiness to you.
O king bow in hands, followed by me and with the help of great sages you should search for the one who has abducted Sita.
We will search oceans, mountains, forests and several dreadful caves, rivers and lotusponds.
We will search relentlessly for the abductor of your wife everywhere including the world of gods and gandharvas till we find her.
O lord of Kosala when gods do not restore Sita on request, then you can think of taking action at the appropriate time.
O king if you fail to get Sita through appeasement, through humility or diplomacy then you destroy (the three worlds) by your goldtipped stream of arrows comparable to Indra's thunderbolt.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, consoling the mighty miserable Rama, who was afflicted with sorrow, and was weeping helplessly like an orphan, drowned in great delusion, devoid of consciousness, pressed his feet and addressed him:
O Rama king Dasaratha begot you by doing a great penance and performing great deeds, just as gods begot the nectar.
King Dasaratha, impelled by your virtues, and separation from you attained godhood as heard from Bharata.
O Rama, if you cannot bear this sorrow that has befallen you, how can weak and ordinary persons endure (such suffering)?
O best of men  if you grieve and burn the world with your brilliance, wherefrom will the (ordinary) afflicted people get relief?
It is the go of the world. Yayati, son of Nahusa, shared heaven with Indra but because of his curse (for his bad conduct) suffered misfortune.
To sage Vasistha, our father's priest, were born a hundred sons in a day.But all of them were killed in one day the same way.
You (rigidly) adhere to truth.(Like you) the mother earth who is adored by all the worlds, is unshakeable. Yet she is seen to be shaking at times.
The powerful Sun and Moon, righteous entities, who are the two eyes of these worlds and on whom everything rests firmly, also suffer eclipses sometimes.
O best among men  Fate spares none. Great beings, every creature, even the gods cannot escape fate.
It is I heard that Indra and other deities are also governed by the principle of justice. Therefore, you should not bewail, O tiger among men.
Even if Vaidehi is killed or abducted, you should not grieve like ordinary men, O sinless hero
O Rama, you always see the truth. So  in the face of great difficulties men like you, whose vision is not blurred, should not lose heart.
O best among men  judge the facts rightly with your intellect. The wise apply their minds and know what is right and what is wrong.
Good results are not expected from the actions of persons who cannot distinguish between their virtues and vices, from those who are unstable in their deeds.
O Rama you yourself in the past have instructed me many times that way. Who can be your adviser in this matter ? You are indeed like Brihaspati.
Even gods cannot fathom your intellect. I am only trying to rouse your wisdom your sorrow has sent to sleep.
O bull among the Ikshvakus, weigh your divine and human prowess before you try to kill your enemies.
O best among men  where is the good in the destruction of all? Know your sinful enemy before you uproot him.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकेय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे षट्षष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Even though Rama was elder, he could grasp the quintessence of the wise counsel only after Lakshmana had said it.
Restraining his anger, the longarmed Rama leaned over  his wonderful bow and spoke to Lakshmana:
O dear Lakshmana, what shall we do? Where do we go ? Think of some means by which we can reach Sita.
Lakshmana said to Rama, afflicted with grief, It is proper for you to (first) search in this Janasthana, covered with different kinds of trees and creepers, and teeming with demons.
Here are difficult mountains, caves, valleys, dreadful caves full of different animals, dwellingplaces of kinneras and mansions of gandharvas.
Accompanied by me you should search for her in those spots. Great people endowed with wisdom do not destabilise in difficulties just as mountains are not shaken by the speed of the wind.
Thus advised, the angry Rama fixed a sharp arrow to his bow and roamed in the forest accompanied by Lakshmana.
Then he saw the great Jatayu, a wonderful bird, looking like a mountain top, drenched in blood and fallen on the ground.
On seeing Jatayu looking like the peak of a mountain, Rama said to Lakshmana, There is no doubt that this bird has devoured Vaidehi.
This demon in the guise of a vulture has evidently eaten away the largeeyed Sita and is happily relaxing in the forest. With my terrific arrows with burning tips that can go straight I will kill him.
Having siad so, Rama took his bow, fixed the sharp arrow, and aimed at the vulture. The seabound earth trembled.
But the vulture who was in a piteous state, vomitting foamy blood, spoke these words pathetically to Rama, son of Dasaratha:
O Longlived one  she who you are searching in the forest like herbal medicine has been carried away by Ravana along with my life.
I have seen her snatched from you and from Lakshmana and carried off by powerful Ravana.
I descended down to protect Sita, and in the battle with Ravana his chariot destroyed fell down here on the ground.
O Rama this is his broken bow, this is his quiver and this is his warchariot all devastated by me.
He is Ravana's charioteer slain by my wings in the battle.  As I was exhausted in the encounter Ravana clipped my wings,  took Sita, and flew into the sky. You need not kill me. I am already slain by the demon.
Having known from Jatayu the story of his beloved Sita, Rama was full of tears, his grief redoubled.
Rama dropped the bow and embraced the king of birds. He fell down despondent on the ground and began crying along with Lakshmana.
Rama saw Jatayu breathing with difficulty in that solitary, inaccessible place.Overcome by greater grief  he said to Lakshmana:
I have been expelled from the kingdom. I am made to stay in the forest. I have lost Sita (my beloved wife). This bird (who was my wellwisher) has been slain. Such misfortune will burn even fire.
Now if I enter even the great sea, the lord of the rivers filled with water, it will also dry up due to my misfortune.
In this world of the animate and the inanimate there is no one more unfortunate than me fallen into the trap of adversities.
This aged king of birds is my father's friend. To my illluck, he is struck down and is lying on the ground.
Saying such words and showing filial affection, he caressed Jatayu repeatedly with Lakshmana.
Rama hugged the king of vultures with servered wings, drenched in blood and asking him where Sita who was as dear to him as his life was, he dropped him and fell down on the ground.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्तषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Seeing the vulture lying on the ground thrown down by the fierce demon, Rama said to friendly Lakshmana:
Struck down by the demon in the combat on my account this bird is going to give up his life which is indeed difficult.
O Lakshmana, it appears he is frightened and is experiencing excruciating pain in the body. His voice sounds faint, too.
O Jatayu If you are still able to speak, tell me about Sita and about how you have been struck down.
Why did Ravana abduct Sita? What fault did he find with me so that he kidnapped my beloved ?
O best of birds how did her delightful, Moonlike face look when she was hijacked. What did she say at that time?
O father  how powerful is that demon ? How does he look?What work does he do? Where does he dwell? Do answer my questions?
Thereafter Jatayu, a piteous soul, looked up at Rama who was  crying incessantly and said this in a feeble voice:
Ravana, the lord of the demons created violent winds through terrific magic and whisked her away in the sky.
O my child  when I was exhausted, that demon cut off my wings and carried Sita off in the southern direction.
O scion of the Raghu race, I am gasping for breath. My eyes are reeling. I see root hair growing on the tops of golden trees.
The time Ravana kidnapped Sita is known as 'Vinda'. The effect (of that time), is that her husband will regain his lost wealth. O scion of the Kakutstha race  he (Ravana )did not know it.
Ravana, king of the demons, will perish soon for running away with your beloved Janaki just like a fish carrying away a fishhook (which causes its destruction).
You need not worry about Janaka's daughter. You will soon enjoy the company of your beloved, Vaidehi after killing that demon.
As he(Jatayu) was speaking to Rama with an alert mind even while dying, blood mixed with flesh started oozing from Jatayu's mouth.
Ravana was Visrava's son and Vaisravana's (Kubera's) brother, said Jatayu and gave up his rare life.
As Rama was saying to the vulture with folded palms 'Tell me, tell me'( about Ravana) the life breath of the vulture soared into the sky leaving the body.
Then Jatayu dropped his head down, his feet thrown about, his body outstretched on earth.
Stricken with deep grief, his eyes red (with tears) Rama saw the vulture looking like a mountain. Seeing him dead, he said to Lakshmana:
Dwelling for many years happily in Dandaka forest, the abode of demons, the bird lost his life (on our account).
This Jatayu, who lived for long years, is lying dead now. (The dictate of) destiny is inescapable.
O Lakshmana, see this Jatayu, my benefactor, killed by the powerful Ravana while he was reaching out to help Sita.
This lord of the birds left his ancestral kingdom of viltures and gave up life for my sake.
O Lakshmana valiant souls and protectors, being righteous and honest are found even among animals and birds.
O scorcher of enemies, O handsome Lakshmana the grief I experience due to Jatayu's death on my account is more intense than Sita's abduction.
This lord of the birds for me is as worthy of reverence and honour as the famous and prosperous king Dasaratha.
O Saumitri  fetch firewood. I shall generate fire by rubbing them and cremate the king of the birds who has laid down his life for my sake.
O scion of the Raghus  I will place the body of the lord of the world of birds, killed by the fierce demon, on the funeral pyre and crimate him with honour.
O mighty lord of the birds  by my grace attain the state of those who perform sacrifices, who kindle and maintain sacrificial fires, who beat no retreat from the battlefield and who offer land in charity. Purified by my offering of fire, you may depart for the best of the worlds.
Thus said, righteous Rama laid him on the pyre and sadly cremated the lord of the birds as one would do to his own relative.
Then the mighty Rama, accompanied by Saumitri, got into the forest and killed a huge deer, brought it and spread it as an offering (to the dead Jatayu).
Tearing the flesh of the deer to pieces and making them  into balls, the celebrated Rama laid it on a lovely, green grassy land as offering to the bird.
Rama muttered the mantras recommended by brahmins for dead mortals as one would do for his father, to help him ascend to heaven.
Then both the princes went down to river Godavari and offered libations for the king of vultures.
Thereafter both the scions of the Raghu dynasty bathed in water, offered libations for the king of vultures as ordained in the scriptures.
The king of vultures had performed a very difficult and glorious feat by laying down his life fighting. Sanctified by Rama's offering as laid down in scriptures by the seers, he attained a holy, auspicious and divine state of the self.
Rama and Lakshmana, like two lords of gods, Indra and Visnu, offered libations for the great bird with their settled minds and concentrated and then entered deeper into the forest turning their attention to the search for Sita.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे अष्टषष्टितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtyeighth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama and Lakshmana offered libations (for Jatayu) and went westward, looking for Sita in the forest.
Wielding bow, arrows and sword, both the princes of the Ikshvaku race went southward and entered an untrodden (densely wooded) tract.
It was a dense, impenetrable and dreadful forest covered with shrubs, trees and creepers spread all over.
The two mighty heroes swiftly forged through the great forest, which was an abode of serpents and lions.
Both the mighty princes of the Raghu dynasty covered a distance of three krosas from Janasthana and entered the impassable kraunchaforest.
Tormented due to abduction of Sita, the two princes anxious to see her searched all over the dense forest stopping here and there on the way. The thick forest looked like a conglomeration of big clouds. It was filled with different kinds of birds, snakes and animals.
Then both the sons of Dasaratha, went further east, crossed the kraunchaforest after three krosas. They saw a dreadful forest which was full of fierce animals and birds near the hermitage of sage Matanga. It was densely covered with trees. They saw there a cave perpetually enveloped in darkness which was as deep as the netherworld.
Both the princes,the best among men, reached the cave and saw a huge demoness with a disfigured face not far from the cave.
Then the two brothers saw a fearful demoness who could strike terror in the mind of the timid, an uncouth figure with huge curved skins, with a big stomach, dishevelled hair, sharp and long teeth, devouring wild animals.
She came close to them, held Lakshmana who was walking ahead of his brother and said Come, let us enjoy.
Taking hold of Saumitri the demoness said 'I am Ayomukhi and I have been obtained by you. You got me, O hero, O lord  For the rest of your life you will sport with me on the lofty hills and river banks.'
Thus addressed, Lakshmana, subduer of enemies, became angry, took out the sword and cut off her ears, nose and breasts.
When the ears and nose of the frightening demoness were cut off she shouted in a fierce tone and ran away in the direction she had come from.
The destroyers of enemies, Rama and Lakshmana of great valour went through the dense forest after she ran away.
Lakshmana of great brilliance and power, of good conduct and pure character spoke to his highly effulgent brother with folded hands:
My arm is throbbing heavily. My mind is agitated. The omens I see foretell some undesirable events.
O noble brother be alert. Heed my words of good advice. The bad omens I see presage perils.
This vanchulaka bird's loud and dreadful screams suggest our triumph in war.
As both the brothers with great prowess were searching for Sita all over, a huge sound exploded as if shattering the forest.
It appeared as though a fierce wind rose from the forest and filled the sky.
While looking for the sound, Rama with his brother saw a demon with a huge body and a big belly.
Then both the brothers saw a very tall figure with a trunk that stood facing them. He had neither neck nor head. His face was in the stomach.
With sharp bristled hair all over the body, he was a mammoth figure who looked like a mountain  resembling a dark cloud with his voice like the thunder.
He had a single eye that was reddishbrown in colour resembling flaming fire. It was fixed in the chest. His eyelashes glowed. He had instant vision with massive fangs in his huge mouth. He was licking his lips.
The terrific demon kept eating bears, lions, deer and elephants, catching with both his arms stretching up to one yojana.
He stood rooted there, catching bears, flocks of birds and deer with both his hands stretching up to one yojana, pulling and pushing them. (Now) he obstructed the path of the two brothers.
Then the brothers after covering one krosa (2 miles) saw a cruel, fierce, mighty monster named Kabandha looking like a trunk. He had a dreadful appearance and his arms encircled the area.
The longarmed demon spread his hands and caught hold of Rama and Lakshmana together by pressing them with all his force.
The two mighty brothers who wielded swords and strong bows and whose bodies were of fiery splendour became helpless, seized by the hands of Kabandha.
Of the two heroes, Rama being courageous was not worried but Lakshmana being younger and not having as much courage, was very much concerned and depressed. He said to Rama:
O heroic Rama see how helpless I am under the control of the demon. Set yourself free, leaving me alone and using me as an offering.
Giving me to this monstor as an offering, you may run away happily. I think you will soon obtain Vaidehi.
O scion of the Kakutstha dynasty, on getting the hereditary kingdom and ruling over it you should always remember me.
O  valiant Lakshmana, a hero like you should not get desparate. said Rama to Saumitri when he was thus entreated by Lakshmana.
In the meanwhile the foremost of the demons, Kabandha, rumbling like thunder questioned the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana:
Who are you with bulllike shoulders, wielding big swords, bows and arrows? By coming to this place you have become my food.
For what purpose have you come? What work have you here ? You have come at the right time as my food, since I am hungry.
Holding bows, arrows and swords, looking like bulls with pointed horns you have entered my mouth. It is impossible for you to live any more.
On hearing the words of the evilminded Kabandha, Rama said to Lakshmana with dried up mouth:
O Lakshmana, your valour is truth.We have gone through from one calamity to a greater one without finding the beloved Sita. Now we have landed into a terrible crisis which will put an end to our own life.
O tiger among men see how powerful the might of time is for all beings Just see  yourself and myself afflicted wth this great calamity.
O Lakshmana look at the power of time over all creatures There is nothing too heavy for time. Even those who know the use of arms in war, or are brave or strong enough, cannot  withstand the force of time like the barriers built with sand.
Firm in the strength of truth, famous and powerful Rama, son of Dasaratha,  determined to act with a steadfast mind, spoke to Lakshmana of mighty manliness on seeing him. इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकोनसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the sixtyninth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Kabandha saw the brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, stand there bound by the shackles of his arms and said:
O bulls among the kshatriyas You are sent by destiny as food to appease my hunger. Seeing me hungry, why do you stand there with your senses switched off ?
Having heard this, Lakshmana, who was greatly suffering gathered courage at appropriate time and said these salutary words:
Before this vile demon gulps you and me let us cut off his long arms with our swords.
This huge, horrible demon with the strength of his arms has conquered the world, and now intends to kill us here.
O prince of the Raghu race  just as the animal brought in the midst of a sacrifice should not be killed, so also for a king to kill any harmless creature is despicable.
The cruel, ferocious demon heard them talk. He opened his mouth and attempted to eat both of them.
Then the agitated brothers, aware of time and space, quickly pulled out their swords and cut off both his arms from the shoulders.
While standing on the right, Rama cut off his right arm and the brave Lakshmana cut off the left.
The strongarmed demon, his arms severed, rumbling like a raincloud filling the sky, the earth and the quarters, fell down.
The demon with his arms amputated, drenched in a pool of blood  looked pathetic and asked them, Who are you?
Imbued with auspicious signs, Lakshmana revealed the identity of Rama to great Kabandha.
Here is Rama, an heir of the Ikshvaku family, known to the people and I am his younger brother Lakshmana for your information.
He is equal to a god in prowess. While living in this desolate forest his wife has been carried off by a demon. We both came here searching for her.
Who are you with only the trunk of the body, and a glittering mouth in the chest with your calf muscles broken rolling down in the forest?
While hearing Lakshmana, Kabandha, reminded of Indra's words, replied to him in great joy :
O tigers among men you are welcome. It is my good luck that I am able to see you. It is my good luck also that the arms that bound you have been amputated.
O best among men hear how I have been deformed due to my haughtiness.इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे सप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventieth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
O longarmed, mighty and powerful Rama in the past I was handsome like the Moon or Indra or the Sun inconceivable to all the three worlds.
With my appearance, I was a great nuisance to the world and used to terrorise the sages living in the forest.
With my appearance I invited the wrath of Sthulasira who I assaulted among the many seers, while he was collecting food in the forest.
Seeing me he pronounced a dreadful curse on me saying, 'You will get a cruel, despicable form.'
When I sought to know how the curse angrily pronounced on me would come to an end, he said:
'When Rama gets your arms in a desolate forest amputated and your body cremated, you would get back your gloriously auspicious form.'
O Lakshmana know that I was the prosperous son of demon Danu. By the wrath of Indra in the battlefeild I obtained this form.
I pleased the creator Brahma with great penance. He blessed me with long life. Then this pride and confusion overtook me.
Having been blessed with long life and thinking, what can Indra do to me?, I attacked him.
The thunderbolt having a hundred nodes deployed by Indra pierced my thighs and my head.
Entreated, he did not send me to the abode of Yama ( lord of death) and said, 'Let the words of the creator be true' .
Hit by the thunderbolt, my thighbones, head and face were broken. Somehow I could manage to live for a long time without food.
Having been entreated, Indra created in me two long arms extending upto a yojana and set my mouth with sharp teeth in the stomach.
Stretching the long arms in the forest, I dragged creatures like lions, tigers, elephants and deer moving in the forest and ate them.
Indra too had said, 'When Rama along with Lakshmana cuts off your arms in a fight,  you would reach heaven.'
O Rama, the best of kings I thought it was only proper in this forest and with this body to catch whatever creature I saw.
O Rama, I was struggling to preserve my body all the time thinking that some day you would certainly come into my arms.
You are that Rama. Be blessed. As stated by the seer I cannot be really killed by any one except you.
O best among men I will help you with my wisdom and give you friendly advice when I am purified by you both through cremation on the funeral pyre.
Rigteous Rama spoke the following words in response to the story of Danu within Lakshmana's earshot:
My illlustrious wife Sita was carried away by Ravana comfortably when I was away from Janasthana along with my brother.
I only know his name. We do not know how he looks, where he lives and what influence he has.
Creatures like you may help those who, like orphans, run here and there, stricken with sorrow.
O hero we will cremate you in a huge pit to be prepared for this occasion, collecting dry logs of wood broken by elephants.
If you really know where SIta has been kidnapped and by whom, tell me. You will be doing a great service.
Danu who was proficient in speech spoke with chosen words to Rama who was a great speaker himself:
I do not have divine wisdom (now). Nor do I know Sita. When you cremate me, I shall assume my original form and will tell you the name of the person who knows it.
O lord before I am cremated, I do not have the ability to know  about that powerful demon by whom Sita has been abducted.
O Rama due to the curse I have lost my wisdom. By my own deed, I have attained this form despicable to the world.
Before the Sun  disappears with his tired horses drop me into a pit and cremate me in accordance with tradition, O Rama
O heroic Rama, delight of the Raghus, if you drop me in a pit and cremate me as per custom, I will tell you about him who knows the demon.
O Rama you should establish friendship with him in a just manner. That hero of swift action will help you when he is pleased.
O Rama, there is nothing that he does not know in the three worlds. In the past for a different reason he roamed all the (three) worlds.इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे एकसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thus said by Kabandha, the two lords of men, the heroes reached a cave in the mountain and lighted the fire.
Lakshmana lit the pyre with big meteorlike logs on all sides and it burned.
As the flesh of Kabandha's body decomposed, if burnt slowly in the fire although it was like a huge mass of fat.
Mighty Kabandha shook himself off the funeral pyre and rose like smokeless fire, wearing a pair of clean clothes and a divine garland.
Thereafter shining brightly in pure clothes and wearing ornaments all over the body, Kabandha hurtled out happily and instantaneously from the pyre.
The effulgent Kabandha rose into the sky on a famous aerial chariot harnessed to swans. Seated on it, he illuminated all ten directions and spoke from the sky,'O Raghava I will truly tell you how you will get Sita, listen to me'.
O Rama there are six expedients (peace,war,marching,neutrality, alliance, making peace with one and waging war with another, for attaining your goal in the world. Only the unlucky can help the unfortunate.
Along with Lakshmna you are passing through a bad period on account of which your wife has been kidnapped and you, lying low, are experiencing great grief, O Rama
O Rama, the best of friends  you should certainly make friendship with him. As I think over the matter, I do not see any success if you do not adopt this method.
O Rama, listen. I shall tell you. A monkey named Sugriva has been banished from the kingdom in a fit of anger by his brother Vali, the son of Indra.
A hero of great selfrespect, he lives with four monkeys on a beautiful mountain Rishyamuka extending up to lake Pampa.
This king of monkeys is energetic with great strength and limitless lustre. He is humble and truthful, valiant, patient and intelligent. He is great.
He is efficient, eloquent, brilliant. He is mighty and strong. (But) he is banished by his brother from the kingdom, O Rama
O Rama he will help you as a benevolent friend in searching out Sita. Do not indulge in sorrow.
O best of the Ikshvaku race whatever is due to happen cannot be otherwise.  It is not possible to transgress time (fate).
O Rama, immediately proceed today from here to mighty Sugriva. Having reached him, make him your friend without malice in the presence of burning fire.
Thinking that Sugriva is only a vanara king, he should not be disrespected. He has a sense of gratitude. He can take any form at will. He is in need of your help although he is very strong.
You are both young and able to do the work he wants. Whether his work is done or not, he will fulfil your task.
Born of Riksharaja, he is the offspring of the Sungod. He has developed enmity with Vali, and is roaming about the banks of Pampa, suspecting danger from Vali.
O Rama, with your weapons kept ready, go to Sugriva, king of the monkeys, a resident of Rishyamuka. He is wandering in the forest. Establish friendship with him.
He is the foremost of the monkeys. He knows well by his wisdom all the dwellingplaces of the carnivorous demons in the world.
There is nothing unknown to Sugriva in this world as far as the Sun shines, O subduer of enemies
Along with his monkeys, he will search all rivers, mountains and caves and will find out your consort.
Sugriva will find out the lady of purity and chastity brooding over you in separation in the abode of Ravana. He can send gigantic monkeys in different directions in order to search for her.
Sugriva, king of the monkeys, will reach the demons  and restore you that blameless, beloved consort of yours, even if she is there on top of mount Meru or in the deep underworld. इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे द्विसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventysecond sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Having shown Rama the means to find Sita, Kabandha spoke again these significant words:
O Rama the delightful path going westward is auspicious for you. It is shining with trees in bloom. There are jambu (rose apple) trees, priyala trees, jackfruit trees, banyan trees, plaksha trees (a tree from which milky latex oozes out), tinduka trees, holy fig trees, karnikaras (of red and white flowers), mango trees and other trees like dryland, thorny trees, tilaka trees, trees that bloom at night, agnimukhya and asoka trees of blue flowers, kadamba trees, karavira trees, red ashoka trees, and paribhadraka trees.
Climbing those trees or else pulling them down with your strength, both of you eat the nectarlike sweet fruits and proceed ahead.
O scion of the Kakutstha race  proceeding further you will find another forest of the North Kuru state with trees in bloom resembling the pleasuregardens of Nandana.
The trees in that garden with fruits of all seasons drip honey. Like the Chaitraratha garden (of Kubera), it bears fruits of all seasons.
The trees with huge branches bent down with fruits look like mountains or clouds.
Lakshmana will get you the nectarlike fruits either by climbing the trees or by pulling them down.
O brave men, pass from hill to hill, forest to forest in great countries until you reach a lake named Pampa.
The slopes of Pampa are without stones or pebbles, O Rama   They are not slippery slopes. They are without moss. The water is neither deep nor shallow. It has smooth beds of sand on the banks and it is full of lotuses and lilies.
Moving in the waters of Pampa you will see swans, ducks, krauncha birds and curlews cackling and cooing, O Son of the Raghus.
Not knowing that they may be killed, the innocent creatures will not be scared of human beings. Both of you can kill and eat the fat birds comparable to balls of ghee.
O Rama, scion of the Raghu dynasty  there at Pampa, by shooting an arrow at the choicest  fishes with a single bone, prawns and big fishes, crookedfaced fishes, fishes without scales and fins, baked on iron skewers and cooked will be offered to you by faithful Lakshmana.
While you delightedly eat the fishes, Lakshmana will fetch you water in a lotus leaf from the Pampa to drink. The waters of Pampa full of lotuses carry their scent, It  is enjoyable, cool, healthy and clear, resembling silver and crystal.
O best of men you will see huge boars of delightful appearance that roar like bulls resting in mountain caves, roaming in the forest and coming to Pampa for its water.
When you stroll in the evening, you will see the trees laden with blossoms and lake Pampa full of cool water. You will forget your grief.
O son of the Raghus  there you will see tilaka trees, night jasmines full of flowers. You will also see blossoming water lilies and lotuses in Pampa.
There is no one to wear those flowers. Those garlands do not wilt or wither O Rama
While drops of sweat from the bodies of sage Matanga's disciples fell on earth under the heavy load of forest products they carried for their preceptor, they remained in a calm state. Those drops of sweat turned into flowers and those flowers do not wither due to the power of penance of the sages.
O Kakutstha  even now their attendant, named Sabari, an old ascetic is there even though they have left long ago.
O Rama, she is established in righteousness, and you are godlike, and revered by all beings. When she sees you, she will attain heaven.
O Rama of the Kakutstha family, you will see on reaching the western bank of Pampa an incomparable site of hermitage concealed in a remote place.
The elephants of the forest and on the mountains do not attack the hermitage forbidden by sage Matanga.
O Rama, you will enjoy your stay in that forest which is like Nandana garden, the garden of the gods, full of various birds.
Mount Rishyamuka situated on the bank of Pampa has trees filled with blossoms. It is difficult to climb and is protected by young elephants.This lofty mountain was created by Brahma in olden days.
Whatever wealth one dreams of in sleep on top of that mountain he will get on waking up, O Rama
If an evildoer or a sinner ascends the (Rishyamuka) mountain, he, in his sleep, will be thrown down with asleep by the demons from there itself. A sinner does not climb this mountain of uneven terrain.
O Rama, the trumpeting of the young playful elephants inhabiting sage Matanga's forest can be heard at Pampa.
The great, nimble elphants, dark like clouds, drenched with the flow of ichor come together and then separate and scatter.
The wandering elephants of the forest drink plentiful water, pure and cool, from Pampa and contented, plunge into the forest.
When you see, shining like sapphires, the bears, tigers, antelopes who know no defeat, you will get over your grief.
O son of the Kakutstha family, there is a beautiful cave in that mountain covered with a slab of stone. It is difficult to enter.
At the eastern entrance of the cave there is a cool watertank. On its bank teeming with various animals are delightful fruits and roots.
Sugriva dwells in that cave with four other monkeys. At times he sits on the top of the mountain.
Having instructed both Rama and Lakshmana, courageous Kabandha, wearing a flowergarland, shone brightly like the Sun in the sky.
Both Rama and Lakshmana, ready to depart, went near the glorious Kabandha waiting in the sky and said, You may go now.
Then Kabandha said to the brothers satisfied, You may go now to accomplish your task. Then he took leave.
Kabandha assumed his true form, his body shining like the radiance of the Sun. He stood in the sky showing his form and looking at Rama, said, Make friendship with Sugriva.इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे त्रिसप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventythird sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The two princes set forth in the western direction towards Pampa shown by Kabandha.
Observing the trees loaded with honeysweet fruits on the mountain, Rama and Lakshmana   went to see Sugriva.
Rama and Lakshmana halted on the slope of the mountain and then departed for the western bank of Pampa.
Both reached the west bank of lake Pampa and saw the delightful hermitage of Sabari.
Both reached the beautiful hermitage full of many kinds of trees. There they saw Sabari, and went towards her.
On seeing them both, Sabari, an accomplished ascetic, got up with folded hands and touched the feet of the sagacious Rama and Lakshmana.
She offered them water to wash their feet and water to sip as per tradition. Then Rama spoke to Sabari who used to perform austere penance:
O ascetic   hope you have overcome your obstacles to penance, you have controlled your anger and your desire for food. Is your austerity in progress.
O Sweettongued Sabari, have you achieved selfcontrol? Has your mind attained peace ? Have your services to the preceptor yielded results?
When Rama asked Sabari who was an old, accomplished ascetic adored by siddhas, she stood in front and replied :
On seeing you now my penance has attained fulfilment, my services to my preceptors have borne fruit.
O best of men, O highest of the gods my birth has become fruitful today with your worship, (you have made) even attainment of heaven quite certain.
O delight of the Raghus, your handsome look has sanctified me, O subduer of enemies, by your grace I will reach the inmperishable worlds.
The men I served have ascended heaven on aerial chariots of incomparable radiance the moment you touched Chitrakuta.
Those great honourable sages who knew the ways of dharma said: 'Rama would visit this sacred hermitage along with Lakshmana. He would be your guest. Receive him with due honour. And you would attain the great, inexhaustible worlds when you see him.'
O best among men I have collected and kept for your sake different kinds of forestfood grown on the bank of Pampa.
Entreated by her in that manner, the righteous Rama spoke to Sabari who was established in true knowledge:
I have heard from great Danu about your power. If you agree, I would like to see this power in person.
At these words from the mouth of Rama, Sabari took them both round the great garden.
O delight of the Raghus see this garden looking like the dense cloud. Full of animals and birds, it is popularly known as Matanga garden.
My precepters, who had perceived the Supreme Spirit made sacrificial offerings in this great garden, invoked gods through the power of mantras. They brought water and offered oblations to the sacrificial fire.
This is the altar named Pratyaksthali where the saints aged and exhausted( by performing chandrayana) whom I worshipped made offerings of flowers with trembling hands.
O Rama see, even now they illuminate the sacrificial altars with the power of their penance. They shed light in all directions with a matchless brilliance.
Look at the seven seas, which have reached here at their mere thought as they could not reach them due to fatigue from fasting.
O delight of the Raghus  look at the bark robes spread on the trees to dry after their bathing which are still wet.
The flowers including lotuses offered by the sages while worshipping gods have not yet wilted.
You have seen the entire garden and have listened what is to be heard. With your permission I would like to give up this body.
I wish to reach those realisers of the Supreme Spirit whom I served and to whom this hermitage belonged.
Rama and Lakshmana on hearing the pious words of Savari joyfully exclaimed, This is really wonderful.
Looking at Sabari who was steadfast in her vow, Rama said, O ascetic, you have worshipped me with devotion. You may go wherever you like (to the world you desire)
With matted locks, tattered bark clothes and deer skin, Sabari consigned her old and emaciated body to the fire at that moment, with the permission of Rama and ascended to heaven, her body glowing like fire.
Adorned with wonderful ornaments and beautiful garlands, anointed with fragrant unguents, robed in most beautiful clothes, she appeared like a streak of lightning, her body shining bright and her face contented.
By virtue of her selfmeditation, Sabari went to that sacred world where the holy sages lived because of their good deeds.इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे चतुस्सप्ततितमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Sabari departed for heaven with her brilliance, Rama  contemplated (about the power of sages)with Lakshmana.
Thinking about the power of the great sages, righteous Rama said to Lakshmana,  his wellwisher with singleminded devotion:
O handsome one, we have seen this highly wonderful hermitage, where deer and tigers dwell together with mutual confidence, where birds of all kinds inhabit.
O Lakshmana, having bathed in the waters of the seven seas (by taking ritualistic bath in these waters) the manes are offered oblations in accordance with tradition.
We have got rid of inauspicious time and good days have come. Therefore, I feel truly happy. Good fortune will appear (now), O Lakshmana, O tiger among men
Come, let us go to Pampa, which is pleasing to look at. Sugriva, the rigteous self, the son of the Sun has been staying for fear of Vali at the shining Rishyamuka, not far from here.
I am hastening to see that noble Sugriva the mighty monkey, as the search for Sita depends on him, O handsome one
To the words of Rama who was of stable mind, Lakshmana replied : My mind too is hastening me. Let us get there quickly.
Then Rama the lord of men along with Lakshmana departed from the hermitage and went to Pampa.
He saw the sacred lake Pampa whose sweet flow of water was used by great seers. It abounded in trees and creepers. Its surface was red with lotuses at one place, white with clusters of lilies at another and with blue lotuses at other places. As such, it looked like a carpet with variegated colours.
Rama reached the Matanga lake which he could see from  a distance and bathed in it.
Lake Pampa was filled with red lotuses and their fragrance.The bank was lined with blossoming mango trees and trees of several kinds like tilaka trees with fruits full of seeds like citron, dhava trees, white trees in bloom, karavira trees loaded with flowers, punnaga trees, clusters of jasmine and kunda shrubs, fig trees, so also reeds, ashoka trees, atimuktaka creepors and several other trees looking like women adorned all over. Rama and Lakshmana passed by, glancing at them. There were other trees full of flowers, huge trees, koyashtika trees with reed. Different kinds of birds such as peacocks, parrots, dwelling in the forest were screaming aloud. Looking at all these in that forest Rama and Lakshmana passed by undisturbed with a composed mind.
Rama saw lake Pampa with cool waters and the groves on the bank filled with tilaka, ashoka, punnaga, bakula and uddala trees.
On seeing different kinds of trees and tanks, the lovestriken Rama visited that great lake.
There were lovely pleasuregardens in full bloom  filled with sal and champk trees. Honeybees on flowers looked lovely and bright. The waters were crystalclear and fragrant with lotuses.The soft sands on the banks of Pampa gleamed. Rama saw them again and again and described them to Lakshmana.
The famous mount, sacred Rishyamuka is situated on the bank of Pampa full of blossoming trees.
The mighty son of Riksharaja, the great soul, the Sun whose son was the wellknown Sugriva, resides on this mountain.
Rama said to Lakshmana, the best of men, who had truth as his strength, Go to Sugriva, lord of the monkeys.
O Lakshmana, deprived of the kingdom I have become a destitute. With my heart attached to Sita how can I live without her ?
Having said these words to Lakshmana who was listening to him with undivided attention, Rama, the best of the Raghus, oppressed by love and afflicted by tears of grief entered Pampa, the delightful lotuslake.
Thereafter, going slowly to a distance, Rama and Lakshmana saw Pampa surrounded by beautiful forests full of many varieties of birds.इत्यार्ष श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये अरण्यकाण्डे पञ्चसप्ततिमस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of Aranyakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.

Ramayan is a epic story.

Known as the ideal man and the epitome of virtue, Rama was born to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya. His life is a model of righteousness, obedience, and moral strength. Rama is depicted as a symbol of truth and dharma, upholding justice even in difficult circumstances. He was exiled to the forest for 14 years due to a boon granted to his stepmother, Kaikeyi. During this period, Rama exhibited patience, humility, and respect for others. His wife Sita and brother Lakshmana accompanied him into exile. Rama is known for his unwavering love and devotion to Sita, and for his immense strength, both physical and spiritual.

He is the son of King Dasharatha and Queen Sumitra and is often considered as the embodiment of brotherly love and sacrifice. Lakshmana chose to accompany Rama and Sita during their exile, despite being newly married to Urmila. Throughout the forest exile, Lakshmana served Rama selflessly, protecting and assisting him in every possible way. His unwavering sense of duty and vigilance is evident when he stays awake all night to guard Rama and Sita. Lakshmana's valor and courage are seen in his fierce battles against demons like Ravana’s son, Indrajit, during the war in Lanka.

Sita’s loyalty and devotion to Rama never waver, even during her captivity in Lanka. She undergoes a trial by fire to prove her chastity after her rescue, highlighting her spiritual purity.

While he is known for his ruthlessness, Ravana also has qualities of a great ruler—his kingdom of Lanka is prosperous and highly advanced.

Originally a loving and devoted wife, Kaikeyi is influenced by her maid Manthara to demand that Dasharatha fulfill two boons he had promised her. She uses these boons to exile Rama and make Bharata the king of Ayodhya. Kaikeyi’s actions are driven by a mixture of ambition and fear for her son’s future, though they ultimately lead to widespread sorrow. However, Kaikeyi’s character is nuanced—her love for Bharata is genuine, and she is not inherently malicious. Her remorse after seeing the pain caused by her demands is profound, and she is eventually forgiven by Rama and Bharata, adding a redemptive element to her arc.

Despite his role in the deception, Maricha initially advises Ravana against the plot, foreseeing the consequences of crossing paths with Rama. Maricha’s character demonstrates the inevitability of fate and the moral consequences of aligning with evil.


Ascetic Valmiki enquired of Narada, preeminent among the sages ever engaged in the practice of religious austerities or study of the Vedas and best among the eloquent.
"Who in this world lives today endowed with excellent qualities, prowess, righteousness, gratitude, truthfulness and firmness in his vows?
Who is that one gifted with good conduct, given to the wellbeing of all living creatures, learned in the lore (knowledge of all things that is known), capable of doing things which others can not do and singularly handsome?
Who (among men) is selfrestrained? Who has conquered anger? Who is endowed with brilliance and free from envy? Who is that when exited to wrath even the devatas, are afraid of (let alone foes)?
O Maharshi, I intend to hear about such a man whom you are able to place? Indeed great is my curiosity".
Invited by Valmiki to take his seat Narada, knower of the three worlds heard him and said with delight "listen to me". And thus spoke.
"O sage rare indeed are men endowed with the many qualities you have described. I  ascertained one. Listen carefully.
People have heard his name as Rama, who was born in the race of king Ikshvaku, having steady nature, possessing incomprehensible prowess, selfeffulgent, selfcommanding and subjecting senses under his control.
He (Sri Rama) is a great intellectual, adherent to rules, eloquent, handsome, destroyer of foes (sins), broadshouldered, strongarmed, having conchshaped neck and   prominent cheeks.
Possessing a broad chest, armed with a great bow, with fleshy collar bones, kneelong arms, a noble head, a graceful forehead and great prowess, he is the destroyer of foes (sins).
Mighty and powerful, he has a wellproportioned body, neither tall nor short, shining complexion, welldeveloped chest, large eyes, lustrous body and good qualities.
Pious, firm in his vows, he is ever intent on doing good to his subjects. He is,  illustrious, wise, and pure at heart. He is obedient to elders (or accessible to those who are dependent on him) and ever meditating (on the means of protecting those who take refuge in him).
Auspicious like Brahma, Sri Rama is the sustainer of this world, destroyer of enemies and protector of all living beings and of the moral code.
He has performed the duties of a king and protected his subjects. knowledgeable in the true nature of the Vedas he is accomplished in military science (he is a great archer).
Sri Rama knows the true meaning of all scriptures and has a retentive memory. He is talented (possessing brightness of conception). He is beloved and welldisposed towards all people (and courteous even towards those who have done him harm). He has an unperturbed mind (even in times of extreme grief) and is circumspect (in doing right things at the right time).
Sri Rama, like sea to rivers, is accessible to men of virtue and has equal disposition towards all. He always has a pleasing appearance.
Sri Rama, bestowed with all virtues, enhanced the joys of Kausalya,  He is like the sea in deportment and like Himavant in fortitude.
Sri Rama is like Visnu in prowess, the Moon in pleasing appearance, the allconsuming fire in anger, the earth in patience, Kubera in chartiy and the Sun in steadfastness.
With a desire to promote the welfare of the people king Dasaratha decided to install   Sri Rama, his eldest and affectionate son as heir (apparent) who was bestowed with  all excellent qualities and true prowess, beloved of the people he was ever intent in the welfare of the people.
Thereafter, having seen the preparations for installation of Rama, queen Kaikeyi who had been promised earlier with boons by Dasaratha demanded of him the exile of Rama and enthronement of Bharata.
Dasaratha, true to his word and restrained by the bond of duty, sent his beloved  son Rama to the forest.
Mighty Sri Rama inorder to please Kaikeyi and obey the word of command of his father, went to the forest and help the king to keep his promise to Kaikeyi.
Lakshmana  beloved brother to Rama is drawn towards him. Endowed with modesty he is an enhancer of the joy of his mother Sumitra. Displaying his fraternal love, he followed  Rama who was departing to the forest.
Born in the race of Janaka and daughterinlaw of Dasaratha, Sita, beloved spouse of Rama is like  his vital breath always desired the wellbeing of Rama she followed him like Rohini, the Moon. Endowed with all virtues she is the foremost woman.
The citizens and Dasaratha followed Rama for a long distance. Rama of righteous nature having approached Guha, king of nishadas, at Shrungiberapura sent back charioteer Sumantra and Rama along with Sita and Lakshmana crossed river Ganga.
Moving from one forest to another and crossing deep and wide rivers with plenty of waters, reached the Chitrakuta mountain by the command of sage Bharadwaja. They raised a hut made of leaves in the forest located in Chitrakuta mountain. and dwelt  there happily resembling devas and gandharvas.
When Rama had set out to Chitrakuta, king Dasaratha, stricken by the grief over the separation from his son and mourning over him departed to heavens.
After Dasaratha had passed away, mighty Bharata did not desire to rule the kingdom  against the orders by Vasishta and other brahmins.
The brave Bharata, who had conquered envy and hatred went to the forest in order to worship Rama's feet.
Bharata reached Rama, so pleasing venerable, truthful and chivalrous, worshipped him with reverence and implored.   Bharata addressing Rama said, 'You are knower of righteousness. You alone should  be the king (meaning that when the elder brother is alive, the younger brother is prohibited from ruling the kingdom)'.
Although a source of universal delight, although exceedingly generous and of cheerful countenance, highly renowned and capable Rama refused to accept the kingdom in accordance with the command of his father.
Having handed over his sandals to Bharata as symbol of authority for ruling the kingdom, Rama persuaded him again and again to return to the capital.
Disaaponted in his mission to take Rama back, Bharata worshipped the sandals of Rama and ruled the kingdom from Nandigrama, awaiting his return.
When Bharata departed, Sri Rama, a man of good fortune and steadfast in vows  one who had conquered under control perceiving that the citizens from Ayodhya would arrive there, entered the Dandaka forest with single minded determination (so that there would not be breach of his promise).
Having entered the dense forest Dandaka, Rama slew the demon Viradha and saw the sages Sarabhanga, Sutikshna and Agastya with his brother.
As directed by sage Agastya, Rama received with extreme delight a bow, a sword and quivers with inexhaustible arrows, given by Indra to Agastya (to be passed on to Rama).
While Rama was dwelling in the forest (in the hermitage of sage Sarabhanga), all the ascetics along with others (sages) inhabiting the forest approached Rama requesting for the destruction of the asuras and rakshasas seizing upon their lives.
Rama promised those ascetics, who resembled flaming fire in lustre living in Dandakaranya inhabited by rakshasas to slay them.
During his stay there a demon called Surpanakha living in Janasthana (resting place for the army of Ravana in Dandakaranya) and capable of assuming any form at will was rendered deformed by Lakshmana.
Thereafter Rama killed in the fight all the rakshasas, Khara, Trisira, and Dushana with their followers in a battle who were instigated by  Surpanakha's words.
During his stay in that forest Rama killed fourteen thousand rakshasas who were inhabitants of Janasthana.
Having heard the slaughter of fellow rakshasa, Ravana became violent with anger and sought the help of a rakshasa named Maricha.
Maricha repeatedly dissuaded him saying, 'O Ravana It  is not proper for you to enter into hostility with the  mighty and powerful Rama'.
Disregarding his words Ravana incited by fate left for the hermitage of Rama along with Maricha.
He with the help of deceitful Maricha drew the princes (Rama and Lakshmana) far away from their hermitage abducted Sita the wife of Rama and  slaughtered vulture Jatayu,
Having seen and heard from the eagle Jatayu struck down by Ravana that Sita had been abducted Rama bewailed, choked with tears his senses dulled by distress.
Then he performed in the midst of tears the funeral rites of the vulture Jatayu. Wandering in search of Sita, he beheld a rakshasa named Kabandha who was dreadful, in deformed in appearance.
Mightyarmed Rama, having killed Kabandha, consigned his body to flames. While leaving for heavens he informed him saying, 'O Raghava, there is a female ascetic in Sabara community, performing religious duties and proficient in practising austerities. You may visit her'.
Rama son of Dasaratha, destroyer of enemies and possessing great splendour approached Sabari who duly worshipped him৷৷
On the bank of Pampa he met a monkey named Hanuman on whose advice he made friendship with Sugriva.
Mighty  Rama related to Sugriva all that had happened right from the beginning, more importantly Sita's abduction and also to Hanuman.
Hearing everything that story from Rama, Sugriva was very pleased and made a pact with Rama in the presence of Agni as witness.
Thereafter Sugriva, king of monkeys filled with sorrow narrated to Rama out of friendship the entire account of his hostilities (with Vali).
Then Rama vowed to slay Vali. The monkey (Sugriva) described about Vali's prowess to Rama.
Doubtful of the prowess Sugriva of Rama Sugriva inorder to get convinced showed him the huge (dead) body of Dundubhi resembling a big mountain.
The strongarmed Rama, who was endowed with great strength looked at the skeleton and smiled within himself for a while. He kicked off the skeleton with the great toe of his foot completely to a full distance of ten yojanas (eighty miles).
Again inorder to create confidence (in Sugriva), he released a single mighty shaft which penetrated seven palmyra trees, a mountain and the Rasatala.
Pleased with Rama's action and convinced of his prowess he left thereafter with Rama he left for Kishkindha which was like a cave.
On entering the city of Kishkindha, Sugriva the best of monkeys of reddish yellow hue roared with a great voice. There upon Vali, the lord of monkeys came out (of the cave).
After convincing his wife Tara, who was dissuading from this, Vali entered into a combat with Sugriva. There, Rama killed Vali with a single shaft.
After he killed Vali in the combat in compliance with the words of Sugriva, Rama installed Sugriva as  king.
The best of monkeys (Sugriva) gathered his monkey forces and despatched them in various directions in search of Janaka's daughter (Sita).
At the suggestion of the vulture, Sampathi mighty Hanuman leapt over the saltocean extending over a hundred yojanas.
Hanuman arrived at the city of Lanka ruled by Ravana and found Sita in the Ashoka garden meditating on Rama.
Hanuman delivered Rama's ring to Sita as a token of recognition, related the whole story and consoled her. He then crushed the arch (of the outer gate of the garden) before leaving.
After killing five commanders, seven sons of the counsellors, stamping out valiant Akshayakumara, the son of Ravana, Hanuman got himself captured (to be taken as captive).
The heroic Hanuman came to know that he could be released from the entanglements of the weapon granted to him through a boon by Brahma. He allowed himself to be restrained by the rakshasas with the ropes for the sake of achieving his other objective of seeing Ravana. Thereafter, he burnt the whole of Lanka except the place where Sita was and returned to deliver the good news to Rama.
Reaching Rama the great Hanuman gifted with boundless intellect circumambulated him and infact informed him that he had seen Sita.
Thereafter, Rama reached the shore of the ocean together with Sugriva and saw the ocean agitated with shafts burning like the Sun.
Samudra, lord of rivers, (afraid of Rama's anger) and having appeared in his own form, and on his advice got a bridge built with the help of Nala.
Rama entered the city of Lanka by means of that bridge, killed Ravana in the battle and recovered Sita. Thereafter he felt greatly embarassed (for accepting his wife who had stayed in an others.
Rama spoke harsh words about Sita in the assembly. Sita, incapable of enduring such words, entered fire.
With the of testimony of the firegod, Rama was exceedingly pleased to know that Sita was sinless. All the gods adored him.
All the animate and inanimate beings, gods and sages in the three worlds were very pleased at this noble deed of the great Rama.
After coronating the rakshasa chief Vibhishana in the city of Lanka, Rama free from distress, exceedingly rejoiced after having accomplished his objective.
Having obtained a boon from the devatas (who had come to see him) Rama, revived all monkeys (fallen in the battle) and set out for Ayodhya accompanied by friends in the  pushpaka (aerial car).
Rama who was a delight of all whose strength lies in truth went to the hermitage of Bharadwaja (as promised) and  despatched Hanuman to Bharata as his messenger.
Again accompanied by Sugriva and recalling earlier incidents and after both of them discussed with each other, Rama departed to Nandigrama riding that pushpaka chariot.
At Nandigrama sinless Rama arrived, met his brothers. They shed their  matted locks. With  Sita  restored  he regained his kingdom.
The entire world rejoiced with happiness with their desire fulfilled they were content.  All people were following the path of righteousness. There was no fear of sufferings or agonies, diseases or famine.
During the period of Rama's rule, no where  would men witness the death of their sons or women widowed. They would ever remain chaste and devoted to their husbands.
There (in the kingdom of Rama) was no fear of fire, water, wind, disease, hunger and also theft.
All the cities and villages were affluent with wealth and food grains. People lived happily as though they lived in Kritayuga.
Highly renowned Rama, having satisfied the gods with the performance of a hundred of aswamedhas and many suvarnakas  bestowing hundreds of thousands of cows and immense wealth on the brahmins, will return to Brahmaloka.
Rama will establish hundredfold royal dynasties and employ the four castes to do their respective duties, in this world.
Rama, reigning the kingdom for eleven thousand years, will attain Brahmaloka.
This story of Rama is sacred and holy. It destroys sins and is equal to the Vedas. Whosoever reads it will be freed from all sins.
This story of Ramayana enhances longevity of those who read it and recite it. They will be worshipped in heavens after their death along with their sons and grandsons, servants and relations.
A brahmin becomes proficient in the eighteen branches of learning a kshatriya gets lordship over landed possessions a vaisya gets the fruits of his business and sudra also attains greatness  by reading Ramayana". इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे (श्रीमद्रामायणकथासङ्क्षेपो नाम) प्रथम: सर्ग:।। Thus ends the first sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing the words of Narada the distinguished and righteous sage Valmiki, proficient in composing slokas worshipped him along with his disciples.
The divine sage Narada after having been worshipped by Valmiki in a befitting manner sought his leave and went to heaven.
After Narada had gone to devaloka, sage Valmiki reached the bank of river Tamasa which is not very far from the Ganges for morning ablutions.
The eminent sage Valmiki reached the bank of Tamasa and seen a descent into the river with pellucid waters, spoke to the disciple standing by the side.
"O Bharadwaja, behold the beautiful and pleasant waters of this river. This holy spot  is as clear and pure as the mind of a virtuous man.
O dear one Put down the pitcher on the ground. Give me my garment. I shall take a dip in Tamasa, the holiest of places".
Asked thus by the nobleminded master Valmiki, Bharadwaja, ever obedient to his spiritual master, gave the sage the bark garment.
Valmiki who had his senses under his command received the barkgarment from the hands of his disciple and wandered about in that extensive forest, looking all around.
Sage Valmiki espied a pair of melodious kraunchas. Flying about in each other's in separable company there in its vicinity.
A sinful and cruelhearted hunter struck down the male bird of the pair in his very  presence.
The female companion saw the male bird struck down by the hunter and rolling on the earth, drenched in blood. Separated from her winged comparion with coppercrested head intoxicated with her love, the female companion lifted a piteous wail.
Then, having seen the bird struck down by the fowler, the pious sage Valmiki was filled with compassion.
Having heard the wailing of the female bird, the sage (Valmiki) moved to pity at this irreligious act uttered the following words.
"O fowler, since you have killed one of the pair of infatuated kraunchas you will be permanently deprived of your position".
Brooding over his utterances, he reflected, 'What is this that I uttered in reaction to the grief of this bird?'
Very wise and learned, he (Valmiki), preeminent among sages, pondered over it (for a while) and spoke these words to his disciple.
"Occasioned by the griefstricken (state of the bird) and composed in rhymed lines each of equal number of syllables tuned to the accompaniment of stringed instruments, let it be known as a sloka and not by any other name".
His disciple, delighted by the excellent verse composed by the sage, committed it to memory which left his spiritual preceptor pleased.
After having performed his ablution at that holy spot according to the prescribed ritual, the sage (Valmiki) returned (to his hermitage), pondering over the matter.
Then saint Bharadwaja, his disciple humble and learned in scriptures, followed him with a pitcher full (of water).
Valmiki who knows dharma entered the hermitage along with his disciple and sat in meditation and composed other stories.
At that moment, the effulgent, fourfaced Brahma, creator and lord of the world, himself, desirous of seeing him (Valmiki), the best among sages, arrived.
Greatly surprised to see him, Valmiki, purified by austerities and disciplined in speech, immediately got up and with folded palms stood before him.
Bowing with reverence as enjoined by tradition and having enquired of his well being, Valmiki worshipped the immutable Brahma by falling at his feet and welcoming him with a seat and water to wash his feet with.
Lord Brahma sat down on a highly worshipful seat and showed a seat for the  ascetic Valmiki to be seated.
Having been ordered by Brahma, he also sat down on a seat. Although seated in the presence of the lord of the worlds, he was absorbed in the thought of events (leading to the death of the krauncha ).
The hunter killed the sweetvoiced krauncha without any cause. That sinfulminded one with hostile feeling of capturing it, had perpetrated this cruel act, he thought.
Griefstricken, Valmiki having become introspective and lamenting the plight of the female krauncha  again and again, recited this sloka.
Thereafter lord Brahma smilingly addressed Valmiki, the preeminent among sages, saying, "You have indeed composed a sloka.There is no doubt about it".
"OBrahmarshi, at my will, this speech had originated from you. Most excellent ascetic, compose the history of Rama in its entirety (in this metre).
Narrate the history of Rama who is renowned for righteousness, virtues, wisdom and steadfastness in the manner you have heard it from sage Narada.
The incidents pertaining to sagacious Rama together with Lakshmana, Sita, Bharata, etc. and the rakshasas  their deeds, thoughts, unknown or known to everybody and even not known to you, will be revealed to you by my grace.
Not even a single word of yours in this epic will ever prove untruthful. Compose this sacred, delightful story of Rama, set in the form of slokas.
As long as the mountains and rivers exist on this earth, the story of Ramayana will prevail among the people.
So long as the story of the Ramayana composed by you is remembered in this world, you will live in the upper world, the nether world and Brahmaloka".
Having spoken these words, lord Brahma vanished. At this he and his disciples were astonished.
Thereafter, the disciples of Valmiki chanted this sloka again and again in delight. They were greatly astonished and spoke about it often.
This sloka of four lines, each consisting of equal number of syllables, was recited by the maharshi. Constant recitation (by others) elicited admiration (from the listeners).
A thought occurred to Valmiki, who is capable of putting thoughts into action "I shall  compose the epic named Ramayana entirely in this metre".
The renowned and sagacious sage composed a kavya with hundreds of charming verses, each containing equal number of syllables and excellent meaningful words set in metre, conferring glory on celebrated Rama.
This story of Rama and the killing of Ravana composed by the sage consists of compound words, melodious sandhis and lines composed in lucid, melodious and meaningful  phrases. Listen to it.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्वितीयस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the second sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Hearing the entire story of Rama from the intellecual Narada, the righteous (Valmiki) sought to know clearly more about the history of Rama endowed  with wisdom.
Having performed achamana, Valmiki seated on kusha grass with folded palms, searched for the course of past events in the history of Rama by his power of penance.
By the power of his penance, the holy sage visualised clearly Rama, Lakshmana and Sita, king Dasaratha, his wives and his kingdom and all that they had observed, experienced, endeavoured during the course of events. He also visualised clearly their laughter and conversation exactly as in real life.
All that was acquired by truthful Rama, Lakshmana and wife Sita as the third person when they were moving in the Dandakaranya forest, was visualised.
With the power of yoga, the righteous (Valmiki) saw clearly, like an amalaka fruit in the palm of the hand the entire course of events that happened in the past relating to Rama.
Highly resplendent Valmiki, having visualised the story (of Rama), with his power of penance and blending the merits of attainment of worldly prosperity and pleasures together with the detailed description of the merit of righteousness as an end and aim, like an ocean filled with gems, got ready to compose the story of delightful Rama which regales everybody's ears.

Divine sage Valmiki composed events yet to happen on this earth in the history of Rama in Uttarakanda.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे तृतीयस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the third sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The divine sage Valmiki, composed in wonderful lines the entire lifestory of Rama who regained his kingdom.
Sage Valmiki composed the Ramayanam in twentyfour thousand verses in six kandas and also Uttarakanda (consisting of five hundred cantos).
The great intellectual and competent Valmiki having composed the Ramayanam including the events of Uttarakanda as well as future events, reflected as to who could translate into performance the epic.
While the highly honoured sage Valmiki was thus pondering over, Kusa and Lava came to him in the garb of ascetics and bowed at his feet.
The sage saw the two illustrious princely brothers, wellversed in dharma and endowed with a sweet voice living in the hermitage.
Valmiki, the master, having found both Kusa and Lava endowed with intellect and accomplished in the Vedas initiated them into the Ramayana composed by him for the purpose of nourishing the Vedas.
Valmiki who practised religious austerities composed this entire epic named the Ramayana which constitutes the great history of Sita and the killing of Paulastya (Ravana).
The twin brothers Kusa and Lava, endowed with a melodious voice,  possessed auspicious form and beauty. They were gandharvas in human form. They looked like the two reflected images of Rama. The contents of this epic, apart from being memorable are sweet and suitable for verbal recitation as well as singing. This charming and attractive kavya is fit to be adapted to the three measures of time and to stringed instruments. It possesses seven notes together with various moodsamorous, compassionate, humorous, heroic, fearful and also violent.

This charming and attractive kavya is fit to be adapted to the three measures of time and to stringed instruments. It possesses seven notes together with various moodsamorous, compassionate, humorous, heroic, fearful and also violent.
These two princes blameless, disciplined and wellversed, committed to memory the whole epic and chanted as instructed in the assembly of rishis, brahmins and saints.
On a particular occasion both the great princes who were dignified and endowed with good features, chanted this great epic in the presence of honoured ascetics who assembled at one place.
All the sages having heard the chanting (of that glorious kavya), experienced great astonishment. Overcome with tears of joy in their eyes, they praised them, exclaiming "Excellent, Excellent".
All the sages steeped in dharma, pleased with them, praised the admirable Kusa and Lava as they sang.
How melodious is this chanting, especially the verses Though it (the events) had happened long ago, it is described as if it is happening at the present moment, exclaimed the audience.
They both chanted in perfect unison in theme and passion, with their charming melodious voice endowed with the rich notes of music (sadja and other).
Praised in this manner by the great sages commendable for their austerities, they chanted even with greater charm and sweetness.
Pleased with the singing, one of the sages seated in the assembly presented them a pitcher. Another sage of renown got so delighted that he gave them garments.
This wonderful epic chronologically composed and completed by the sage (Valmiki),  is the supreme source for poetry.
The two singers, proficient in all kinds of notes recited the epic in the streets and on the principal roads. It was pleasing to hear for all. It gave long life and prosperity to the listeners. People admired them. Once Rama happened to see them.
Thereafter, Rama, the destroyer of enemies, having invited the two brothers Kusa and Lava who deserved honour. He brought them to his royal palace and extended respectful hospitality.
Rama, the tormentor of enemies, surrounded by his ministers and brothers occupied the splendid golden throne.
Then selfpossessed Rama, having seen those very handsome brothers (Kusa and Lava), addressed Lakshmana, Satrughna and Bharata, saying:
"Listen to this story sung by both of them, portraying excellent sense and words". Having said this, Rama urged the singers with the lustre of devatas to commence.
Both of them, with good and ample voice, chanted the kavya in a distinctly meaningful way. Tuning their stringed instruments, they sang melodiously and engagingly.
The chanting of the kavya in the assembly of men comforted the sense of hearing. The listeners rejoiced in their mind, heart and the whole being.
Addressing the assembly of men Rama said "Both Kusa and Lava, even though ascetics, are endowed with the attributes of royalty. Eventhough they are singers, they are ascetics. This is even conducive to my wellbeing. Listen to the meaningful story with concentration".
Encouraged by the words of Rama, the two brothers chanted according to marga mode of singing (classical style). Even Rama who was in the assembly desirous of peace, concentrated his mind on that chanting.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुर्थस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the fourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana in synopsis of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Formerly, this entire earth belonged to  those victorious kings starting from Prajapati (Manu).
Among them a king named Sagara got the ocean dug and his sixty thousand sons surrounded him whenever he went (to battle).
It was from the family of mighty monarchs with Ikshvaku as its founder and the kings born in that race, the celebrated epic known as the 'Ramayanam' arose.
I shall propagate this Ramayanam, incorporating the merits of dharma, artha and kama, and complete in all respects. It deserves to be heard right from the start without prejudice.
On the banks of river Sarayu, a great and prosperous country named Kosala, abundant in foodgrains and wealth and inhabited by contended people, was situated.
In the country called Kosala was the famous capital city of Ayodhya built by the lord of men, Manu .
With welllaid out thoroughfares, the beautiful and prosperous city of Ayodhya extended for twelve yojanas in length and three yojanas in breadth.
It looked splendid with its welllaid out and broad highway strewn with flowers and regularly sprinkled with water.
King Dasartha, augmenting the prosperity of the great kingdom, lived in the city of Ayodhya like Indra in heaven.
The city where all kinds of artificers lived had arched outer gateways, wellarranged local markets and all kinds of instruments and weapons.
With matchless splendour, it abounded in eulogists and genealogists. It contained stately edifices decorated with flags and hundreds of sataghnis (missiles).
The city with suburban towns on all sides had several female dancers and actors.It was filled with gardens and mangogroves. And girdled by sal trees.
It was enclosed by strong fortifications and a deep moat. No enemy can ever enter and occupy that city. It abounded with several elephants and horses, cattle, camels and mules.
It was embellished with a host of tributary kings who used to pay tributes and with  merchants from different countries.
Like Indra's Amaravati, it was adorned by mountains and mansions with precious stones.
With groups of men and women and adorned with sevenstoried palaces, it looked wonderful like a board where the game of ashtapada, is played. It was rich in all kinds of gems.
Its dwellings were constructed on levelled ground with no space left unutilised it was abundant stocked with fialgrained rice and water which fasted sweet like sugarcane juice.
The city echoed with the sounds of trumpets, mrudangas, vinas and panavas. There was no city on earth superior to Ayodhya.
Like an aerial car acquired by the siddhas in heaven through their austerities, the palaces were perfectly constructed in rows and inhabited by the noblest of men.
The city was inhabited by thousands of warriors known as maharathas. They were skilled archers and sharphanded. They would not pierce with arrows, solitary persons, persons without defence, fleeing foes who could be tracked down through hints from sound. With sharp arrows or with the strength of their arms, they would kill roaring and inebriated lions, tigers, boars etc. in the forest. It was in that city (of Ayodhya) that king Dasaratha lived.
That city (of Ayodhya) was filled with excellent dwijas (brahmana, kshatriya and vaisyas) performing rituals of sacrificial fire, virtuous and wellversed in the Vedas and Vedangas. They were generous, truthful and dignified. They were almost equal to rishis and maharshis.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चमस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the fifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
From that city of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha ruled the entire world, following the tradition of Manu who was a highly powerful protector of the people. Dasaratha was well versed in the Vedas. He commanded all resources. Farsighted, he possessed great prowess. He was dear to the inhabitants of towns and villages. Among Ikshvaku kings, he was a great charioteer capable of fighting with many maharathas singlehanded. He performed many sacrifices and was devoted to the practice of dharma. He was in full control over his subjects. He was a great sage, a royal saint and renowned in the three worlds (Bhooloka, Bhuvarloka and Suvarloka). He was mighty. He was a destroyer of enemies. He had scores of good friends. He had perfect control over his senses. In riches, he was comparable to Indra and Kubera.
King Dasaratha, who always kept his word and followed dharma, attained prosperity and pleasure in equal measure by righteous means ruled that best of the cities as Indra ruled Amaravati.
The people living in that excellent city were happy, virtuous, wellread (in the Vedas and the sastras) and content with the possessions of their own. They were free from avarice. And always spoke the truth.
In that best of cities, there was not even a single householder who had not adequate wealth or who had not achieved dharma, artha and kama or who did not possess the wealth of foodgrains, cattle and horses.
The lustful, the miserly, the unscholarly and atheists were not to be seen anywhere in the city of Ayodhya.
All men and women (in the city) were of righteous conduct, fully selfcontrolled and prosperous with good conduct and behaviour. They were pure like maharshis.
In the city, there was none without earornaments, without coronet, without wearing garlands and none unclean. And none without the anointment of fragrants on the body.
(In the city of Ayodhya) there was no one who did not eat food to full satisfaction and was not charitable. None was found without wearing ornaments on the hands and bracelets on the upper arms and around the neck. Also no one could be seen who had not restrained his passions and emotions.
In the city of Ayodhya there was none who did not kindle the sacrificial fire. There was none who did not perform a sacrifice. There were no thieves or meanminded persons or persons of improper descent of mixed castes.
The brahmins were always interested in the performance of their duties. They had control over their senses. They were charitable and studious. They were selfcontrolled  while accepting charity and maintaining marital relations.
That time there was no atheist, no liar and none ignorant of the sastras. There was no one who was jealous, incompetent or illiterate.
There was no brahmin who was not well versed in the Vedangas or who did not perform religious vows. There was not even one  who would not donate in thousands. There was no one distracted or depressed.
In Ayodhya, there was no man or woman who was not endowed with wealth or beauty. It was not possible to see any one who had no devotion for the king.
There in Ayodhya the best of cities, the first of the four castes (brahmins) used to worship gods and guests. They had the sense of gratitude. They were munificient, heroic and possessed prowess. They lived long. They were righteous and truthful. And they lived together with their sons, grandsons and wives.
The kshatriyas were obedient to brahmins and vaisyas followed kshatriyas. Sudras assisted the three castes and all were fully occupied in their respective professions.
That city was ably governed by Dasaratha, scion of the Ikshvakus, in the same way as it was  previously administered by (Manu), the foremost among men and and the most intelligent.
It abounded with warriors, like a cave with lions. They were almost like flaming fire, the most determined among experts and accomplished in learning (the science of arms).
The city was full of excellent horses born in the regions of Kambhoja, Bahlika, Vanayu and Sindhu, similar to that of Indra's horse (called Ucchaisrava).
It was full of intoxicated elephants born in Vindhya mountains, elephants of enormous strength looking like mountains and born in the Himalayas. Elephants of good breed hailing from the family of  Airavata (Indra's vehicle), Mahapadma, Anjana and Vamana.
The city (of Ayodhya) was always full of intoxicated elephants resembling mountains belonging to the races of Bhadra, Mandra, Mriga and interbreed of these three races, interbreed of races of Bhadra and Mandra, Bhadra and Mriga, Mriga and Mandra.
The city where king Dasaratha lived and ruled, spread over a distance of sixteen miles. And it was worthy of its name.
Mighty king Dasaratha, of great brilliance vanquished his foes and ruled the city like the Moon over the  stars.
The king who equalled Indra (in splendour) ruled the invincible city of Ayodhya true to its name with its strong gates and solid locks. It was adorned with wonderful edifices teeming with thousands of men. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षष्ठस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the sixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana  the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The ministers of the great descendent of the Ikshvakus were endowed with all virtues. They were competent counsellors, skilled in judging motives from facial features and were always intent on doing good and all that was dear and helpful to the king.
The mighty and glorious (king Dasaratha) had eight ministers who were free from blemish in their dealings and ever devoted to royal duties.
The eight ministers were Dhrishti, Jayanta,Vijaya, Siddhartha, Arthasadhaka, Ashoka, Mantrapala and Sumantra.
He had two wellchosen excellent rishis, Vasishta and Vamadeva, as family priests besides some other counsellors.
They were welleducated in all branches of knowledge and deemed unjust acts shameful. They were renowned, proficient, versed in sastras, wealthy and magnanimous. They had their senses restrained and their deeds were in accordance with their words. They acted with determination. They were brilliant, forgiving and reputed. And always spoke with a smile.
Either in anger or for pecuniary gains or for fulfilment of desire, they never uttered an untrue or unjust word. In the midst of their own people or among their enemies, they knew, through spies everything being done or had been done or intended to be done in future.
They knew how to deal (with people). They were true to their friends. They used to impose appropriate punishment even on their own sons.
They were experts in replenishing the exchequer and in collecting the army. They never inflicted any punishment even on those who were not their wellwishers, if they did not commit any offence.
They were heroic. They possessed steady perseverance. They followed the state policy and always protected the virtuous people living in the state.
While ensuring that they did not cause pain to brahmanas and kshatriyas (in thought, word and deed), they filled the treasury. They inflicted stringent punishments on a man after examining his strength and weakness.
While the ministers of chaste conduct administered the kingdom with unanimous decisions, there was no one who was a liar, either in the city or in the kingdom.
In that kingdom no one was wicked or enamoured of others' wives. Serenity prevailed over the entire kingdom including the city of excellence.
They all were welldressed in fine clothes. They possessed good character with an eye on justice and vigilant about the king's welfare.
They imbibed virtues from the elderlies. They were renowned in prowess. They were guided by their intellect in all affairs. They were wellknown everywhere.
The ministers were inherently well aware of the real nature of peace or war. They were affluent, adept in keeping secrecy and sharp in comprehending the points (before making any decision). They were experts in the science of ethics and morality. They always spoke  pleasing words.
The faultless king Dasaratha, with the assistance of such ministers endowed with virtues, ruled the earth.
In the three worlds he (Dasaratha) was acclaimed in the three words as munificient and upholder of truth, a tiger among men, who ruled protecting and guarding the people through spies. He. ruled the kingdom with righteousness by deserting irreligious and keeping the subjects happy.
The king (Dasaratha) had many friends. All the tributary kings were obedient to him. He killed his enemies with his might. There was no foe who was either superior to or equal to him. He ruled the world as Indra ruled the heaven.
Accompanied by the ministers who were devoted to his welfare, adept in counselling, skilful, capable and loyal towards him, the king acquired glory like the rising Sun with luminous rays.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तमस्सर्ग: ।। Thus ends the seventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Such a majestic, righteous, and magnaninous king had no son to perpetuate the race even though he performed austerities for one.
While reflecting over the matter, a thought struck the magnanimous king: 'Why not invoke gods by performing a horsesacrifice for a son'.
Having made up his mind to perform the sacrifice, that sagacious and pious king, in consultation with his wise ministers, issued the following command to Sumantra, the best of ministers "Bring all my spritual preceptors along with family priests."
Virtuous king Dasaratha paid homage to them (the ministers) and uttered these gracious, righteous and meaningful words.
There is no happiness for one who has no son. This is the cause of my intense suffering. Therefore, I have made up my mind to perform a horsesacrifice.
Therefore, I intend to perform a horsesacrifice in accordance with the scriptures. How  can I fulfil my desire in this regard? You may deliberate and find a solution".
The brahmins along with Vasishta in the forefront extolled the king's decision, exclaiming, 'Well, Well'.
Highly pleased, they all said to king Dasaratha, "Requisite articles be collected for the sacrifice and the  horse be released."
'O king, the wish that arose in your mind is just and right. You will definitely obtain sons as desired by you.'
On hearing the words of the brahmins, the king was pleased and said to his ministers with eyes excited with delight.
"Let the  articles required (for performing the sacrifice) be procured in accordance with the words of my spiritual preceptors and the horse be released under the protection of able men.
On the northern bank of  Sarayu, a sacrificial pavillion be prepared according to the  methods ordained in the 'Kalpa'. Auspicious rites be performed in accordance with the ordinance for its uninterrupted completion.
If obstructions and omissions do not occur in the conduct of this best of sacrifices, it will be possible for every king to get the results.
The learned brahmarakshasas always look out for flaws in the sacrifice so that they can spoil it. If a flaw finds place, the doer of the sacrifice is immediately destroyed.
Therefore let the arrangements be made in a manner this sacifice is completed in accordance with the scriptures. And in this, you are experts".
Having heard these words of this Indra on earth (king Dasaratha) all the ministers with due respect replied: "May it be as ordered".
Bowing to this best of kings (Dasaratha), all the brahmins who were experts in austerities left all the knowledgeable brahmins as they camewith his permission.
After sending away the brahmins, the king said to his ministers: "Let this sacrifice be performed as enjoined by scriptures and as directed by the officiating priests".
Having thus ordered his ministers sitting nearby, sent this highly brilliant, this preeminent among kings them away and entered the inner apartment.
Thereafter the king said to his dearest wives: "I intend to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain sons. Therefore, you, too, commence religious discipline."
On listening to these exceedingly charming words, their bright countenances shone resplendent like lotuses after the departure of winter.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे अष्टमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the eighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The charioteer tells the king in privacy that he has heard the advice given by the offciating priests.
"O king, the divine Sanatkumara had narrated a story about your posterity in the presence of sages.
Kasyapa has a famous son named Vibhandaka. It was prophesied that he would have a son named Rsyasringa.
Grown up in the forest and always moving with his father, that sage knows none other than his father.
O eminent king, sage Rsyasringa celebrated in the three worlds who practises a twofold brahmacharya life (life of celebacy) described by brahmins (as vratitva and prajapatya).
Worshipping the firegod and attending on his renowned father, he will spend a long time living in this manner (practising vratitva mode of brahmacharya).
At this time a powerful king Romapada, mighty and celebrated would be living in the country of Anga.
Because of violation of code of conduct by the king, a terrible, dreadful drought frightening all living beings will set in the kingdom.
With drought prevailing, the griefstricken king, would summon all those grown old with learning and tell them.
Those brahmins versed in the Vedas, said, to 'O king bring here Rsyasringa, son of the sage Vibhandaka by all means'.
"O monarch, on having brought Rsyasringa here, honour him, and offer him your daughter Santa with due reverence.
On hearing their words, the king in a thoughtful mood said, 'How can the mighty sage be brought here'?
Thereafter the confident king, having decided, in consultation with his ministers to bring him (Rsyasringa), sent the priest with the counsellors on this mission.
On hearing the king's words, distressed and frightened by rishi's power, they   appealed to the king, faces bent down, 'We will not go'.
After thinking  about the means to be employed to bring the rishi to the court, they told him they would bring the sage if they are not to blame (in case anything untoward happens).
Thus with the help of courtesans of the king of Anga, when the son of the sage (Rsyasringa) was brought rains followed. The king offered his daughter Santa (in marriage to the sage).
'Risyasringa, your soninlaw, would help you to obtain sons'. Thus said Sanathkumara which I have related to you.
Thereupon Dasaratha, pleased, (with him), said to Sumantra, "Describe in detail the  means by which Rsyasringa was brought (to the court of Romapada)".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे नवमस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the ninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana of the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thus prompted by king Dasaratha, Sumantra said,  "I shall relate to you the manner in which Rsyasringa was brought to the court. Listen to me along with your ministers".
The priest accompanied by ministers said to Romapada, "We have thought over a plan which will never fail."
"Rsyasringa, residing in the forest, is engrossed in the study of the Vedas. He is not acquainted with women and sensual pleasures.
By means of  such things that can cause sensual pleasures and overpower the minds of men, we shall be able to bring him to the town. Let it be decided quickly (said the ministers)
Beautiful and welladorned courtesans, may be sent there. They will allure him by various means and honourably bring him here.
The king, having listened to these words, conveyed his approval saying, 'Let it be done that way'. The priests and ministers acted accordingly.
Having heard this, beautiful courtesans entered the great forest and remaining at a  place not far from the hermitage made efforts to steal a sight of this son of a sage (Rsyasringa), this forest dweller, this controller of the senses.
He (Rsyasringa) was always content and never stirred out of his father's hermitage. Absorbed in penance he had never seen  a woman or a man nor any of the creatures born in towns or cities right from his birth.
One day this son of Vibhandaka (Rsyasringa) accidentally came to the place where he saw the beautiful women.
Those wonderfully attired women singing with sweet voices approached the son of the sage (Rsyasringa) and said:
'O brahman Who are you? How are you subsisting? We wish to know why you are roaming alone in this dreadful forest? Could you tell us.'
He had never seen such charming women in the forest. He developed affection towards them and a desire arose in him to speak about his father.
'My father is Vibhandaka. I am his own son. My name is Rsyasringa. I am known the world over by this name associated with my karma'.
'O auspiciouslooking women, our hermitage is nearby. I will extend to you due hospitality'.
After listening to the words of the sage's son (Rsyasringa), all the beautiful women with a desire to see the hermitage  accompanied him.
Thereafter the son of ascetic respectfully received the the strangers saying, "(Accept) our offerings, here is water for washing feet and  here are roots and fruits".
The anxious courtesans received the offerings and afraid of the ascetic's return, made up their minds to withdraw immediately.
'O brahmin, these are excellent fruits. May prosperity be to you. Accept them and eat them without delay.'
Then, all the courtesans embracing him with joy, offered plentiful sweetmeats and various items of food.
The lustrous (Rsyasringa) who had never tasted any food other than what was offered by the permanent forestdwellers mistook them for fruits.
The ladies apprehensive of (the arrival of) his father took leave of him on the pretext of  observance of (evening) rites.
When they all departed, Kasyapa's son, the brahmin roamed (Rsyasringa) with a restless mind  charged with sorrow.
On the following day, the sage armed with the power of penance, came to the place where he had seen those enticing, welladorned courtesans.
All of them were rejoiced on seeing the brahmin approaching them, came nearer to him and said:
'O handsome one, come to our hermitage. A special, sumptuous hospitality will be extended to you', they said.
Having heard their words pleasing to the mind, he agreed to go with them. And the women took him away.
As the illustrious sage was being brought (to Anga) the god of rain (Parjanya) suddenly inundated the earth which looked cherful (with rain).
The king (Romapada) went out to welcome the ascetic, the brahmin who brought along with him rains to his country. He humbly bowed down his head and prostrated before him.
He gave that Indra among the brahmins offerings righteously with unstinted devotion and asked for his favour that he should not incur the wrath of the sage (his father Vibhandaka for having brought him to Anga).
The king entered the inner apartment, duly offered him his daughter Shanta in marriage and experienced peace and satisfaction.Thus he (Rsyasringa) lived there, with all his desires fulfilled" (said Sumantra).              इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे दशमस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the tenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"Great king, I shall tell you the way Sanatkumara, great among the celestials further narrated the story. Listen to my words which may prove useful to you (said Sumantra)".
That king (Dasaratha) will develop friendship with the king of Anga. A highly virtuous daughter named Santa will be born to  king of Anga.
The famous king Dasaratha will approach the son of the king of Anga known as Romapada.
O righteous king I am issueless. Let Rsyasringa, husband of Santa be ordered to perform the a sacrificial ceremony so that I shall be blessed with I son for the perpetuaion of my race.
On hearing his words and deeply thinking over the matter, the prudent Romapada  agreed to send, Santa's husband (Rsyasringa), capable of blessing him with a son.
The king relieved of his suffering, was highly delighted. He would take the brahmin with him and  perform the sacrificial ritual.
King Dasaratha, lord of the people, and knower of dharma and truth, desirous of performing the sacrifice would ask Rsyasringa, with folded palms for granting a boon to perform a sacrifice in order to obtain children and to attain heaven. The king will get those desires fulfilled through that chief brahmin.
Four sons of immense prowess would be born to him bringing glory and fame to their dynasty. They would be renowned in all the worlds.
In early times of Kritayuga, this story was narrated by the holy and competent  Sanatkumara, the great one among the devatas".
"Greatest among men, O king, along with vehicles and retinue, you may go and bring him (Rsyasringa) personally with due respect".
Having heard the charioteer's words and having obtained the consent of Vasishta, he    along with his queens and courtiers departed to the place where the brahmin (Rsyasringa) resided.
Crossing forests and rivers slowly, the king reached the place where that foremost of ascetics lived.
He reached the spot and saw the son of the ascetic, the best of brahmins glowing like fire seated next to Romapada.
Then the king (Romapada), delighted at heart out of friendship with the king (Dasaratha), offered special hospitality with respectful salutations in accordance with propriety.
Romapada explained his friendship and relationship with him (Dasaratha). Rsyasringa of great intellect in return felicitated Dasaratha.
In this manner, the great among men, the king wellhonoured by Romapada, spent seven or eight days there.And then spoke this to Romapada:
O lord of people, O king, It has been decided to commence an important sacrificial rite. You may send your daughter Santa along with her husband to my city.
Having agreed to the departure of the sage Romapada said, 'Be pleased to go (to Ayodhya) together with your wife'.
The son of the sage assented to the king's command saying 'So be it'. And permitted by him, departed along with wife (for Ayodhya).
Dasaratha and Romapada, pleased with this, wished each other with folded palms and hugged each other with love.
Then king Dasaratha, took leave of  his friend and set out. He despatched swiftfooted messengers to the citizens with the command.
"Let the entire city be welldecorated, perfumed, sprinkled with water and cleaned with flags hoisted."
The people of the city having heard the king's arrival were overjoyed. They did everything as by the king.
Then the king entered that welldecorated city amidst blares of conches and the beating of drums, with the best of the brahmins (Rsyasringa) in the forefront.
The citizens were delighted to behold that brahmin entering the city duly honoured by the king who was equivalent to Indra in valiance৷৷
He (king Dasaratha) took him in to the inner apartment and extended welcome. He thought that he has as enjoined by the sastras accomplished his objective by bringing him (Rsyasringa).
All the royal ladies, experienced immense delight when they saw the largeeyed Shanta arriving  along with her husband in that manner.
Honoured and worshipped by royal ladies, especially by king Dasaratha, Santa dwelt there for some time comfortably with the sage.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकादशस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the eleventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
After a long time, at the advent of charming spring a desire arose in the mind of the king (Dasaratha) to perform the sacrifice.
Then bowing his head in respect to that brahmin who was effulgent like a celestial  and having won his grace he chose him to conduct a sacrifice for a son for (the continuity of) his dynasty.
The wellhonoured brahmin agreed, saying, "Be it so, let the requisite materials be procured and the sacificial horse, released".
Thereafter the king said to Sumantra, "Summon immediately, Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali and Kasyapa, family priest Vasishta and other foremost and learned brahmins who are the official priests wellversed in the Vedas".
Then Sumantra, a man of smart movement went immediately and brought all those brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas.
After paying respect to them (learned brahmins), virtuous king Dasaratha graciously uttered these words charged with dharma and artha.
"There is no happiness for me. I am overwhelmed with grief as I have no son. Therefore, I intend to perform a horsesacrifice.
I wish to perform the yaga acording to scriptural procedures. And I will have my desire fulfilled by the grace of the sage (Rsyasringa)".
When they heard these words from the king's month, those brahmins heades by Vasishta extolled the king's decision exclaiming, "wellsaid":
The priests led by Rsyasringa replied to the king, saying, "Let the sacrificial articles be procured and your sacrificial horse released."
"Since this righteous thought for begetting children has entered your mind, you shall surely get four sons of immense prowess".
Pleased to hear the brahmins' words, the king happily addressed his ministers with auspicious words:
"In accordance with the instructions by my spiritual preceptors let the articles (required for performing the sacrifice) be procured and the horse  released under the protection of warriors accompanied by the chief priest".
Let a sacrificial pavillion be constructed on the northern bank of Sarayu according to prescribed methods ordained in the 'kalpa' and other scriptures for the uninterrupted completion of the sacrifice.
If in this best of sacrifices aswamedha, obstructions and omissions do not occur it will be possible for the king to get the results.
The learned brahmarakshasas always look out for flaws in the sacrifice so that they can strike into it. If the sacrifice is damaged, the doer of the sacrifice will be immediately destroyed.
Therefore let the arrangements be made in a manner by which this sacifice is completed in accordance with the prescriptions in scriptures and you are experts in doing so".
Honouring the words of the king, all the ministers did as ordered.
Admiring the great king, the knower of righteousness, the brahmins permitted by him  returned to their places as they had some.
When the great brahmins  departed, the glorious king (Dasaratha) sent away his ministers and entered his palace. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्वादशस्सर्ग:।।2Thus ends the twelfth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
After completion of one year when spring returned, the valiant king (Dasaratha) entered the sacrificial pavilion to worship celestial beings for begetting sons.
After offering humble salutations and worshipping sage Vasishta in accordance with prescribed ordinance for begetting children, he obediently said:
"O foremost among ascetics O brahman, may the sacrifice be performed according to  tradition in such a manner that the sacrifice is performed unhindered.
You are an affectionate friend and most reverential spiritual guide to me. The burden of performing the sacrifice which has since commenced shall be borne by you".
The great among brahmins answered him saying "I shall do everything as proposed by you".
Thereafter Vasishta summoned those brahmins who are experienced in the sacrificerelated activities venerable and righteous architects skilled workers brick makers, carpenters, diggers, artisans, account keepers, dancers and actors, men versed in scriptures and honest, wellinformed people and addressed them saying, "In accordance with the king's command let the work of the sacrificial ceremony be inauguarated. Let thousands of bricks be brought. Let temporary residential buildings be erected with all the comforts to accommodate royal guests."
In the same manner let widely spread residential accommodation be furnished with many items of food and all kinds of entertainment be provided for people from other lands.
In the same way people coming from rural areas also should be duly, not casualy treated with respect.
People from all castes should be welltreated with respect. There should be no insult to any one through lust on greed on anger.
The people deeply immersed in performing sacrificerelated activities and sculptors be specially honoured according to their nature of work. All of them should be satisfied with money and food.
Every thing should be wellmanaged. In whatever manner you do, not even the smallest things be left out. Carry out the work with love and affection in your hearts".
Then all of them approached Vasishta and said, "everything has been wellarranged in accordance with your instruction. There is no deficiency. Everything will be done as instructed by you without leaving out anything."
Then Vasishta, having summoned Sumantra said to him "Invite all the righteous kings on earth".
"Extend an honourable invitation to brahmins, kshatriyas, merchants and sudras in their thousands residing in all countries.
You may personally go and bring with due honour king Janaka who is the distinguished king of Mithila, a warrior whose truth is his strength proficient in all scriptures and the Vedas. Since he is an old ally, I am telling you in advance.
Similarly, you may personally escort king of Kasi who is always affectionate and sweettongued. He is a friend to our king who is a lion among rulers.
Likewise bring here the aged and very righteous king of Kekaya along with his sons. He is fatherinlaw to this lion among kings (Dasaratha).
Bring with honour king of Anga, Romapada, famous and prosperous. He is an intimate friend of the king (Dasaratha).
Bring kings from the countries of the eastern and southern regions, from Sindhu, Sauvera and Saurashtra৷৷
Bring all other kings of this earth, who are friendly with us. Along with their retinues, families and relatives".
Having heard the words of Vasishta, Sumantra speedily despatched virtuous and auspicious emissaries to bring the kings.
In accordance with the ascetic's order, righteous Sumantra himself quickly set out to escort Janaka and other kings.
All the workers reported to the wise sage, Vasishta about the tasks completed for the sacrifice.
Then, well pleased, the best among brahmins (Vasishta) said to them all "Nobody should be offered any thing with disregard. Anything given with contempt undoubtedly  results in the destruction of the donor."
Meanwhile kings from several countries to travelling nights and days arrived bringing with them various kinds of (precious) gifts.
Thereupon, wellpleased, Vasishta addressing Dasaratha said "O best among men, beacuse of your command, kings from various countries have arrived. I have extended due hospitality to those noble kings according to their station."
"O king, persons with composed minds have made preparations for the yaga. Now be pleased to leave for sacrificial altar nearby to perform yaga.
O foremost of kings, you ought to see the sacrificial ground full of sources of entertainment arranged everywhere, as though improvised by imagination".
In response to the words of Vasishta and Rsyasringa, the Lord of the earth (Dasaratha) entered the sacrificial pavilion on a favourable day presided over by an auspicious star.
At that moment the best of brahmins led by Vasishta and headed by Rsyasringa, entered the sacrificial enclosure and began the sacrifice in accordance with traditions and scriptural stipulations.                     इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रयोदशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
After completion of one year when the sacrificial horse had returned, the sacrifice by the king (Dasaratha) commenced on the northern bank of river Sarayu.
The best of brahmins led by Rsyasringa performed the rituals of aswamedha organised by the exceedingly magnanimous king.
The chief priests, masters of the Vedas, conducted the rituals in consonance with traditions and scriptures. They officiated in conformity with duties laid down in the Vedas and according to law.
Brahmins performed pravargya and upasada and other ceremonies as per the scriptures and traditions.
Thereafter the eminent ascetics, rejoicing in their hearts performed the worship (of celestial beings) and conducted the prescribed rituals starting with morning ablutions etc.
Havis was duly offered to Indra daily. The juice was extracted in the morning by pressing the soma plant. Midday ablutions were performed. All in proper sequence.
Those exceedingly noble and eminent brahmins performed third pressing of the soma, in conformity with the sastras.
There were no omissions in the offerings nor any lappes in the performance. Everything was done through recitation of mantras and in a wholesome way.
During the days (of sacrifice) none felt tired or hungry. There was no brahmin who was not learned or had less than a hundred followers (or disciples).
During that period brahmanas as well as those who have masters, (the sudras), ascetics and monks had enough to eat.
The aged, the sick, women and also children ate there and knew no limit to their enjoyment.
"Give food, give, various kinds of clothes" echoed the organisers. And they (in charge of distribution) did.
There, could be seen day after day heaps of nicely cooked food, looking like mountains.
Men and women who had come from various countries to that sacrifice were entertained with food and drink by the magnanimous (king).
Brahmins having tasted the delicious food cooked in prescribed manner, praised saying "Ah We are fully satisfied. Prosperity to you". Such were the words heard by king Dasaratha.
While brahmins were being served with food by welldressed men, some others wearing pendents studded with shining jewels assisted them.
In the interval between ceremonies, eloquent and sagacious brahmins were engaged in various disputations, desirous of victory.
Every day in that sacrifice brahmins, skilful in rituals, persuaded (by sage Vasishta), performed all their duties as per tradition.
Here (in this sacrificial pavillion), there was none who was not versed in six Vedangas, not true to vows, not learned in many sastras nor adept in discussions (on sastras).
When the time came to erect sacrificial posts, six posts each made of bilva and khadira wood and many made of parni wood along, one of sleshmataka and two of devadaru wood, with a distance of two outstretched hands between them were erected.
All these posts were prepared by knowers of sastras and by those wellversed in the performance of sacrifices. They were decorated with gold to add elegance to the sacrifice.
These twentyone sacrificial posts, each measuring twentyone 'aratni' height, were welldecorated wrapped in a piece of cloth.
All those posts, strong with eight sides and finely finished surfaces, wellcarved  by sculptors were duly erected.
Decorated with flowers and sandal paste and covered with cloths, stood the  bright sacrificial posts shining like seven sages in the sky.
The sacrificial fireplace was constructed with bricks with standard measurement by brahmins who were experts in the art of measuring land with a string or single strand.
That sacrificial altar of the lion among kings, (Dasaratha), erected by welltrained brahmins was in the shape of the golden winged 'Garuda' it had three ranges and thrice as many fireplaces i.e eighteen in number.
Animals, serpents and birds were kept ready after the sastras intended (for sacrifice) for those respective deities.
When the time came to sacrifice the animals, the chief priests, in accordance with tradition, tied up the horse and all the aquatic animals to the sacrificial posts.
Three hundred animals and the jewel of the horses (from the stables) belonging to king Dasaratha were bound to the sacrificial posts.
Kausalya, with immense glee having gone round and worshipped that horse, severed it with three strokes of scimitar.
Kausalya, in her devotion to duty and with a happy state of mind, passed one night near that horse.
Hota, Adhvaryu and Udgata arranged Mahishi, Parivritti, Vavaata and another woman known as Palakali to touch (keep the company of) the sacrificial horse.
The official priest, highly knowledgeable in scriptures and having restrained senses, removed the marrow from the horse and cooked it according to tradition.
The king at appropriate time and in agreement with the scriptures inhaled the odour of the smoke (from the burnt marrow) and absolved himself of his sins.
The sixteen officiating priests (brahmins) offered all the horse's limbs with prayers as per the customs.
In other sacrifices oblations are offered with branches of a plaksha tree but in Aswamedha a branch of cane creeper is chosen instead.
According to Kalpa sutra, aswamedha in conducted for three days. In the first day, chatushtoma is arranged.
On the second day Ukthya and on the third day Atiraatra were performed. Many sacrifices fixed according to the scriptures were also performed.
Jyotishtoma and Ayuryaga in Atiratra, Abhijit, Viswajit and Aptoryama ceremonies constituting the great sacrifice were performed in the prescribed manner.
In order to promote his dynasty, king Dasaratha gave away eastern region to Hotar, western region to Adhvaryu, southern region to Brahma and northern region to Udgata. These offerings were made in accordance with theprescriptions by Brahma long all.
The king best among men and upholder of his dynasty, having concluded the sacrifice according to law, offered this entire earth as gift to priests.
But all the priests said to the king purged of his sins, "O Lord of men you alone are capable of protecting this earth".
"O ruler of the earth We are constantly engaged in the study of the Vedas. We are not capable of ruling the earth and we cannot do anything with its possession. Give some other charity in lieu of that.
O best of men give us gems or gold or cows or whichever is readily available. We have no use with this earth".
Lord of men, the king having been thus addressed by brahmins who were wellversed in the Vedas, bestowed on them ten hundred thousand cows, a hundred crore of gold coins and four times as much in silver coins.
All the priests collectively offered that wealth to sage Rsyasringa and Vasishta endowed with prudence.
Then those highly pleased brahmins, having distributed that wealth with equity, again said to the king.
Thereafter, with earnestness king Dasaratha bestowed a crore of gold coins to brahmins who had come to see the sacrifice.
Dasaratha then gave his excellent bracelet to a poor brahmin who solicited alms.
When the brahmins were pleased, king Dasaratha who was fond of brahmins bowed to them with his eyes filled with delight.
Brahmins uttered blessings upon the generous king when he prostrated before them according to procedure.
Sacrifice destroys sins. It leads to heaven. It is incapable of being done by other monarchs. King Dasaratha was very much pleased after performing this great sacrifice.
King Dasaratha then addressing Rsyasringa said "O Adherent of vows you can help the continuity of my race".
Rsyasringa, the best of brahmins, addressing the king said, "O King Let it be. Four sons perpetuating your race will be born to you".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुर्दशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fourteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rsyasringa, a highly  intellectual and knowledgeable one in the Vedas, pondered for a while, revived his memory  and said to the king.
"I shall perform putriyeshti to help you beget sons. This is to be done in accordance with tradition for fulfilment of desires through mantras as declared in a portion of the Vedas, 'atharva siras'" .
To help Dasaratha beget sons, brilliant Rsyasringa  commenced putriyeshti, a sacrifice for begetting children, by pouring oblations into sacrificial fire and chanting mantras in accordance with traditions.
All the celestial deities etc., along with gandharvas according to tradition, gathered at the sacrifice to receive their share of offerings.
All devatas assembled there as per tradition and thus addressed Lord Brahma the creator of the worlds:
"O lord a rakshasa by name Ravana who had obtained prowess through your grace is oppressing us. We are unable to punish him.
Pleased with his penance, Lord, you had granted him a boon. By honour that boon and daily endure all his cruelty.
The evilminded Ravana is inflicting pains on the three worlds. He hates the guardians of the earth and intends to assault Indra, lord of the celestials.
Because of your boon he has become unassailable and puffed with pride deties sages, yakshas, gandharvas, demons and brahmins.
The Sun does not scorch him  and the wind does not blow by him. Even the ocean with its incessantly moving waves becomes still in his presence.
His dreamful appearance of that rakshasa strikes terror into us. O Lord do find some means to kill him".
After listening to the words of the devatas and reflecting over the matter, Brahma said,    "Oh, the means of destruction of that wicked (rakshasa) has struck my mind".
When he asked gandharvas, yakshas, gods, demons or rakshasas should never be able to kill him, I said, "So be it".
"The rakshasa did not include man monkey and bear because of his disdain for men. As such he is fit to be destroyed by a man and not by any other means".
Having heard these pleasing words uttered by Brahma, all the devatas and maharshis were overwhelmed with joy.
At this juncture Visnu the lord of the world, highly effulgent and bearing conch, discus and mace in his hands and in yellow apparel arrived.
Lord Visnu stayed there with a composed mind after meeting Brahma Then thus spoke the devatas prostrated before Visnu and paying him homage with hymns.
"O Visnu we pray for the welfare of all the worlds. The sovereign of Ayodhya, king Dasaratha is a righteous, virtuous and  generous king equal with rishis in lusture. Pray form into four and incarnate in the of four sons of his three wives, resembling hri (modesty), shree (auspiciousness), kirti (fame).
"O Visnu assuring human form, kill Ravana in the battle. He has become a source of torment to the worlds and is invincible by gods.
"That stupid rakshasa, Ravana, with his haughty prowess, is terrorising the gods, gandharvas, siddhas and great rishis.
It is reported that a cruel rakshasa with his haughty prowess has tortured rishis, gandharvas and apsaras sporting in Nandana groves.
We siddhas, gandharvas and yakshas along with ascetics, have hence come here to devise ways of his death. We take refuge in you.
O tormentor of enemies, O Visnu, you are the supreme, refuge for all of us. Resolve to be born in the world of men for the destruction of enemies of the gods (rakshasas)".
Visnu, the lord of the celestials, foremost among the gods and bowed by all in the worlds addressed the assembled devatas who were guided by the law of righteousness and were led by the grand sire, Brahma.
Lord Visnu, supreme soul having given boon to devatas in this manner, reflected as to the place where he should take birth as a man in this world of men.
Thereafter, the Lord with eyes like the lotus petal was pleased to transform himself into four forms and to choose king Dasaratha as his father.
Then along with gandharvas, groups of apsaras, rishis, rudras and devatas sang in praise of the 'Lord Slayer of Madhu', with hymns of celestial beauty.
"Therefore, uproot that mighty Ravana possessing frightful prowess, inflamed pride, limitless insolence causing agony to the three worlds, a source of vexation to ascetics and  a dreadful enemy of Indra.
Kill Ravana, the cause of distress in the worlds, kill his forces and relatives. Them return to heaven  protected by Indra after freeing from distress, faults and sins".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चदशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fifteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Although Omniscient lord Narayana knew the means to be employed, when he was requested by the best of devatas he spoke to them softly:
"What strategies should be adopted in the matter of destruction of that evilminded Ravana who is a thorn to the sages?".
When the devatas were thus addressed by the imperishable Visnu, they replied him saying, "You may assume the form of a human being and slay Ravana in the battle".
"O destroyer of foes Lord Brahma was very pleased with Ravana's intense penance over a long time৷৷
Pleased, with the rakshasa Brahma granted a boon to the effect that except from men, there was, for him, no fear of death from any other living beings. Ravana ignored men while seeking the boon.
Having obtained the boon from Brahma, Ravana, greed and arrogant went on bringing  destruction to the three worlds. He carried away women by violence. O destroyer of foes his death is possible by men only."
Having heard the words of devatas, selfpossessed Visnu chose king Dasaratha as his father.
At that time, the brilliant king (Dasaratha), destroyer of enemies, who had no sons was performing a sacrifice for sons.
After Visnu had decided (to incarnate) and he was worshipped by devatas and maharshis he disappeared bidding farewell to Brahma.
During the sacrifice, there emerged from the sacrificial fire a mighty being with unmatched splendour, his prowess and strength. He wore a black and crimson garment. He had a red face. His voice was similar to the sounds of a drum. He had whiskers of soft and shining tawny hair resembling the mane of a lion He had fine hair on his head. He was endowed with auspicious signs and adorned with splendid divine ornaments. His height resembled a mountain peak. He walked with the strides of a ferocious tiger. Similar to the Sun in radiance, he looked like the crest of a blazing fire. This divine being held like his beloved wife both hands, a large vessel made of gold purified, in fire, covered with a silver lid and filled with payasam (a preparation of rice in milk and sugar). It looked as though it was created  by magic.
Having seen king Dasaratha, he said, "O King you know I have been sent by Prjapati (Brahma), and I am here".
With folded palms the king replied, "O revered lord. Welcome to you. What can I do for you?".
Thereafter the one who came from Prajapati answered, "O King you have obtained this payasam today in return for the worship offered to the devatas".
"O Lion among kings, receive this payasam prepared by gods, conferring progeny, bestowing affluence and improving health.
O King you are performing this sacrifice for the sake of sons. Give this to your  worthy consorts to consume it. They will bear you sons".
Dasaratha was pleased to receive respectfully the golden vessel filled with the payasam  prepared and bestowed by devatas.
Overwhelmed with great joy, he, walked around that wonderful being of pleasant  countenance again and again and saluated him respectfully.
Dasaratha who received the payasam prepared by devatas was highly pleased like a poor man who received wealth.
Then that effulgent figure of wonderful form having given the bowl of payasam vanished from there.
The inner apartment, brightened with rays of happiness, shone like the autumnal sky in the glow of the moon.
He entered the inner apartment and addressing queen Kausalya said, "Receive this payasam which has the power to give you sons".
Then Dasaratha gave half the portion of payasam to Kausalya, half of the remaining half to Sumitra, half of the remaining portion (oneeighth of original) to Kaikeyi for the sake of a son. On further thinking, he gave the remaining oneeighth portion to Sumitra. In this manner the king divided and distributed the payasam among his wives separately.
The virtuous wives of the king were exceedingly delighted and felt honoured after receiving the payasam .
Then the excellent consorts of the king who glowed like fire and the Sun, having consumed the choicest payasam, became pregnant in a short time.
The king now regained his composure of mind on seeing his pregnant wives. He looked delighted like Visnu worshipped by Indra, and hosts of siddhas and rishis.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षोडशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Visnu had decided to be born as the son of that great king (Dasaratha), the selfborn Lord (Brahma), addressed all devatas :
Create strong and powerful beings capable of assuming forms at free will to extend support to Visnu who is  true to his word, heroic and benevolent.
Incarnate as monkeys in the womb of  chiefs of apsarasas and gandharvas. Create sons who have the knowledge of deceitful tricks, who are brave, who match wind in speed, who are endowed with intellect and statecraft, who are determined, who are  knowledgeable in various means of achieving victory, who are supernatural  bodies, who possess capability of employing and resisting weapons, who resemble those who subsist on amrita (immortals) and are equal (to Visnu) in prowess.
Earlier Jambavan, the foremost among bears was suddenly emerged out of my face while I was yawning.
Instructed by Brahma in that manner, all of them gave birth to sons in the form of monkeys.
Distinguished rishis, siddhas, vidhyadharas, uragas, charanas procreated (in the form of monkeys) heroic sons who became forestdwellers.
Indra gave birth to Vali, chief of monkeys resembling Mahendra mountain and having a mighty body. Sun, great among those producing heat, begot Sugriva.
Brihaspati begot the intelligent monkey Tara who  had none to surpass him among the monkey chiefs.
Kubera begot glorious Gandhamadana and Viswakarma begot a great monkey Nala.
Neela, the prosperous son of Agni the firegod who equalled him in glow surpassed other monkeys in energy, renown and prowess.
Aswini devatas, endowed with wealth and beauty, procreated Mainda and Dwivida who were highly esteemed for their beauty.
Varuna begot the monkey warrior Sushena and Parjanya, Sarabha of great strength.
Vayu, the windgod, begot a son named Hanuman, mighty and graceful, having a body as hard as a diamond and speed equal to Garuda's.
Thousands of warriors possessing immeasurable strength and courage and capable of assuming any form at will were created to kill Ravana.
Endowed with bodies similar to the Meru and Mandara mountains and having  great strength, bears, monkeys, monkeys with cowtails quickly came into being.
The sons of devatas retained characteristics like beauty, form and prowess of their procreator (gods).
Some monkeys with acknowledged, valour were born to female monkeys with tails         Similarly some other monkeys were born to female bears and female kinnaras.
The devatas, rishis, gandharvas, garudas, yakshas, kimpurushas, siddhas, vidyadharas, uragas and many others were immensely pleased. Thousands of gigantic monkeys wandering in forests were procreated from principal apsarasas  vidhyadaris, nagas, and  gandharvas.
They were endowed with the powers to assume any form at will. They possessed enormous strength and power to freely wander in forests. They were like lions and tigers in pride and prowess.
They all could strike with rocks, use nails and teeth and trees as weapons. They were skilled in the use of all kinds of weapons.
They could shake mountains and uproot deeprooted trees. With their speed they could cause disturbance to Samudra, the lord of the rivers.
They could cause cleavage to this earth with their feet, cross the mighty ocean with one leap and enter the sky and even seize the clouds.
They could capture wild elephants sojourning in the forest and make the flying birds drop down screaming.
A crore of monkeys capable of assuming any form at will, great monkeys and commanders of monkey forces were created.
Those monkey commanders created heroic monkeys among the chief monkey clans who later proved the best among clanleaders.
Thousands of monkeys dwelt on the plateaus on the top of mountains abounding in bears. Some others inhabited various hills and forests.
All those leaders, Nala, Neela, Hanuman and others dwelt near those two brothers Sugriva, the offspring of Surya and Vali, the son of Indra.
Endowed with the might of Garuda and wellversed in warfare, all of them  moving around tormented ferouious lions, tigers and mighty serpents .
Mighty armed leader Vali endowed  with immense prowess  protected, with his strong arms all those bears, gopuchhas(cowtailed) and monkeys.
Born in many forms  wih various characteristics (relating to the body and tribe), they pervaded this earth with its mountains, forests and seas.
In order to assist Rama, this earth was filled with commanders of those who led the monkey forces resembling masses of clouds and mountains. They loan endowed with immense strength and fearful forms and countenances.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तदशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the seventeenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Completed by the magnanimous king (Dasaratha). The aswamedha and putreshti sacrifices, the devatas received their share of havis and returned to their respective  abodes.
Having completed the prescribed vows (in respect of aswamedha), king Dasaratha together with his queens returned to the city of Ayodhya accompanied by his attendants, army and chariots.
Having been honoured by the king (Dasaratha) in a be fitting manner, the highly pleased lords of the earth (kings) made obeisance to the best of sages (Vasishta) and returned to their own countries.
When the army of the kings left the city (Ayodhya) for their own, the armed forces shone bright and cheerfl.
After the departure of the rulers, the exalted king Dasaratha preceded by the foremost of brahmins entered the city (of Ayodhya).
Having been duly honoured by king Dasaratha, sage Rsyasringa with his wife Santa  accompanied by the wise king Romapada and his followers set out for his country.
When they (guests) all departed in this manner, Dasaratha with his desire fulfilled, his thought centred on begetting sons lived happily.
Six seasons (one year) passed after the completion of the sacrifice. In the twelfth month of Chaitra on the ninth day (of the bright fortnight), with Aditi as presiding deity when the star Punarvasu was in the ascendent and the five planets Sun, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter and Venus, were exalted in their own house in karkata lagna, when Brihaspati was in conjunction with the Moon, Kausalya gave birth to a son: a facet of Visnu, Lord of the entire universe who received obeisance from all the worlds and was adorned with all auspicious signs, the venerable one  to perpetuate the Ikshvaku race.

Kausalya glowed with the undiminished lustre of her son, just as Aditi with  her son Indra, the foremost among the gods and  the wielder of thunder.
As an incarnation of the  fourth part of Visnu, imbued with all virtues, and armed with truth Bharata was born to Kaikeyi.
Sumitra gave birth to Lakshmana and Satrughna who were heroic, skilled in the use of all weapons and endowed with the facets of Visnu.
Bharata endowed with pure intellect was born in meena lagna when pushya was in the ascendant. Lakshmana and Satrughna were born in karkata lagna with the star aslesha .
Four worthy sons were successively born to the noble king (Dasaratha), endowed with all virtuous, resembling purvabhadra and uttarabhadra  stars in brightness.
The gandharvas sang melodiously. Groups of apsaras danced. Celestial kettledrums were sounded. Flowers were showered from the sky. Men througed to Ayodhya to witness the festivities.
The highways were crowded with men, thronged by actors and dancers. The voices of singers, performers on different instruments, eulogists and genealogists reverberated.
The king distributed deserving gifts to priests, euologists and genealogists. He gave brahmins in charity thousands of cows and other valuables.
After a lapse of eleven days, the naming ceremony was performed. Highly delighted preceptor Vasishta named Kausalya's son Rama, Kaikeyi's son Bharata, one son of Sumitra, Lakshmana and the other Satrughna.
Brahmins as well as inhabitants of the city and rural areas were feasted. (Dasaratha) bestowed on brahmins unlimited and abundant jewels in charity. The rites at the time of birth and all other rites (associated with the newborn) were duly performed.
Among them, Rama like the exalted flag, became dear to his father like Brahma he was highly respected by all living beings.
All the sons (of Dasaratha) became wellversed in the Vedas. They were heroic, endowed with knowledge  and virtues and were devoted to the welfare of the people.
Among them  the highly lustrous and truly mighty Rama was stainless (in character). He was auspicious to the entire world like the Moon.
Accepted as skilled in mounting elephants, riding horses, driving chariots and also in archery, he was always emgaged in the service of his parents.
Right from his very childhood Lakshmana, an enhancer of fortune, always remained very  attached to his eldest brother Rama, the delight of the world.
Lakshmana,  possessed of fortune, was the dearest to his brother than his own body. As though he was his life without.
Rama, the greatest among men would not sleep without Lakshmana's company. He would not partake even the choicest food minus to him.
Whenever Raghava (Rama) went hunting into the forest, riding the horse, Lakshmana used to follow him holding bow and arrows (in his hand).
In a similar manner Satrughna, younger brother of Lakshmana, became dearer than his own life to Bharata. Similarly, Bharata also was dear to Satrughna.
With his very fortunate sons, Dasaratha was highly pleased like Brahma was with the gods.
All his sons were enriched  with knowledge and endowed  with all virtues. They were modest, renowned, omniscient and farsighted. Dasaratha rejoiced at the sight of those glorious sons with such faculties and looked like Brahma, Lord of the worlds.
They (like) tigers among men, were fond of the study of the Vedas  and were always engaged in the service of their parents. They were also proficient in the science of archery.
Then the virtuous king Dasaratha deliberated with his priests and kinsmen about the marriage of his sons.
While the nobleminded king was thus deliberating in the midst of his counsellors,  there arrived the effulgent ascetic Viswamitra.
Desirous of seeing the king (Dasaratha) he accosted the doorkeepers, saying "Inform the king quickly about the arrival of Viswamitra, the son of Gadhi born in the line of Kusika".
On hearing those words (of Viswamitra) all of them prompted by fear because of left for the royal apartment with excited minds and hurried steps.
Having reached the royal hall, they reported to the king (Dasaratha), descendant of the Ikshvakus about the arrival of sage Viswamitra.
Having heard their words, Dasaratha in great joy went forth together with his preceptors to receive him like Indra receiving Brahma.
Seeing Viswamitra, shining with the power of his penance fulfilled the king with a cheerful countenance made offerings with due respect.
Viswamitra received the offerings as ordained in the scriptures and enquired from the king about the welfare and prosperity of his kingdom.
The exceedingly virtuous sage Viswamitra enquired from the king about the treasury welfare of his subjects living in cities and villages, and the well being of his friends and relatives.
Are the tributary kings submissive to you? Have you conquered your enemies? Are the rites for propitiating gods and the services to humanity  performed rightly?
The foremost of ascetis, Viswamitra approached Vasishta and all other distinguised sages following the protocal and enquired about their welfare.
All of them with gladdened hearts entered the royal palace and sat down, in accordance with their position after having been duly honoured by the king.
Then the munificent king, very much (at Viswamitra's arrival) pleased offered him a happy hospitality and spoke:
"O great sage, welcome to you Your arrival, to me, is like nectar (to a human being), rains to the parched land, birth of a son to the childless through his worthy wife, recovery of lost properity and festive joy in a great achievemnt.
Earlier you were rajarshi, a warrior sage. By your austerities you have obtained the brilliance that lends radiance even to the Sun and the Moon you have gained the status of a brahmrshi. In several ways you are worthy of my worship.
O Brahman your arrival has caused surprise to me. It has conferred great purity on me. O Lord by your very presence here, I feel I haved acquired the merits of a          pilgrimage.
Be pleased to tell me the purpose of your visit. I desire to be given the privilege of doing service to achieve your object.
O Viswamitra you need not hesitatate to tell me what ought to be performed. I shall accomplish that act in every possible special way. You are a god to me.
O Brahmin I have attained this high foutune today. My great merit has been realised as a result of your arrival".
On hearing the words spoken in such an humble manner by the prudent king words pleasing  to the mind and to the ears, the great rishi of  celebrated virtues and fame, of sterling qualities experienced deep delight.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे अष्टादशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the eighteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Having heard these wonderful words of Dasaratha, the lion among kings, the brilliant Viswamitra with hair on end replied:
"O Tiger among kings having been born on earth in an illustrious lineage and initiated by Vasishta, this way (of speaking) befits you. It cannot be any other way.
O Tiger among kings I shall unfold the purpose conceived in my mind. Take a decision and be truthful to your promise.
O best among men for the successful completion of a sacrifice I took up a selfimposed  religious observance. Two rakshasas, capable of assuming forms at will, are creating impediments to that sacrifice.
When my sacrifice generally speaking, is nearing completion the powerful and welltrained Maricha and Subahu who are raining streams of blood and flesh upon the altar.
The (solemn) vow for observance of religious rites being thus interrupted, I left that country as an exerted and discouraged man.
O King my mind does not permit me to vent my wrath. The nature of sacrifice is such that I refrain from cursing them.
O tiger among kings it is befitting of you to entrust your eldest son Rama to me who is valiant, young (having sidelocks of hair) and true to his prowess.
Protected by me and by his own divine power, Rama is capable of destroying even those demons causing impediments to the sacrifice.
I will confer upon him, without doubt, a lot of blessings for his wellbeing by which he will attain fame in all the three worlds.
Both of them (Maricha and Subahu) will not be able to withstand Rama in any way. Rama, and Rama alone, is capable of destroying them.
Proud of their strength, the two wicked demons have been noosed by Yama, the god of death. O tiger among kings they are no match for the magnanimous Rama.
"O king it is not proper for you to hesitate because of your paternal affection. You need to know that both the rakshasas will perish. This, I assure you.
I know Rama who is a great soul, true to his prowess and also Vasishta of great lustre and these other sages who have been steadfast in asceticism also know.
O king of kings, if you are seeking the benefits of righteousness, great everlasting fame in this world, it is fit and proper to give Rama to me.
O Kakustha if your counsellors and all other sages headed by Vasishta give their consent, then only you may relieve Rama.
You should spare your dear son, the lotuseyed Rama, impartial and detached, for ten nights.
O (Dasaratha), descendant of Raghu act in such a manner that the time for my sacrifice is not delayed. Do not indulge in grief. Prosperity to you"
After speaking these words charged with dharma and artha the great sage resplendent Viswamitra fell silent.
Having listened to those auspicious words of Viswamitra, the king among kings, (Dasaratha) experienced intense grief out of fear. He became despondent.
The great king felt shaken off his throne after listening to the words of the sage (Viswamitra) which broke his heart and terribly upset his mind.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये  बालकाण्डे एकोनविंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the nineteenth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing Viswamitra, words the tiger among kings (Dasaratha) lost his senses for a moment  and  on regaining his consciousness spoke this way.
"My lotuseyed son Rama is less than sixteen. I do not think  he has ability to fight with the rakshasas in a battle.
Here is the whole akshauhini (army) of which I am the lord and sustainer. Accompanied  by the  akshauhini I shall engage those rakshsasas in the battle.
These servants of mine are warriors, valiant, powerful and courageous, skilled in the use of weapons and fit to engage multitude of rakshasas in battle. It is not proper to take Rama with you.
Wielding bow in hand I will protect the sacrifice. As long as my life sustains, I will engage the rakshasas in the battle.
.I shall go there, protect the sacrifice and see that it is conducted without obstacles. It is not proper to take Rama with you.
Rama is still a child, he is not learned in the science of warfare,he does not know the  strength and weakness of enemies. He has not acquired  as yet the strength of using  weapons and is not proficient in warfare. You know certainly those rakshasas are deceitful in battle. And hence he is not qualified to oppose them in the battle succesfully.
Separated from Rama, I do not like to live even for a moment. O tiger among ascetics, it is not proper to take Rama with you.
O sage of great vows, O brahman if at all you intend to take Rama with you, take me  also along with my army.
O scion of of Kusika family, sixty thousand years have passed since I was born.  Rama was born to me after a great deal of suffering. It is not proper to take him with you.
My love for Rama among all my four sons is supreme.It is not proper for you to take Rama, the eldest son whose prime qualification  is his virtue.
O best of sages, how powerful are those rakshsas? Whose  sons are they? Who are they and how huge is their body? Who are protecting them?
O brahman, how to rebuff those deceitful warriors either through Rama or through my army or through me?
O venerable one, how to fight those wickednatured ones in the battle and stay aginst them? For rakshasas are proud of their prowess". Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Viswamitra said:
Ravana, king of rakshasas, is the brother of Kubera and son of ascetic Visravana. He is said to possess great prowess.
Although endowed with great strength, Ravana, by himself, never created impediments to the sacrifice. But two rakshasas by name Maricha and Subahu are incited by him to cause obstacles".
Informed in this manner by sage Viswamitra, king Dasaratha addressed the sage,  saying, "I am not competent enough to stand before those evilminded rakshasas in the batlle".
"You are the knower of righteousness. Extend your favour to my little son and also to me for I am so who is unfortunate. You are verily my spiritual preceptor and god.
Gods, danavas, gandharvas, yakshas, birds and great serpents cannot withstand Ravana in battle. What are men to him? (They are no match to him).
That rakshasa pulls out warriors' prowess in the battle. O foremost of ascetics Either with forces or with my sons it is not possible for me to engage him or his forces in battle.
O brahman although my son resembles the celestials he is not experienced in warfare. On no account shall I spare him.
Further the sons of Sunda and Upasunda by name Maricha and Subahu are causing obstacles to your sacrifice. They resemble the god of death, Yama. I shall never part with my son.
Maricha and Subahu not only possess prowess but also are experienced in warfare. Together with my group of friends I can combat with one of the two".
Having heard the statements of the king the son of Kusika, Viswamitra who was like Indra among the ascetics was seized by great anger. As though fire in the form of  maharshi blazed like the sacrificial fire into which oblations of clarified butter have been poured. ।। iऋफफछफौ चफळउफp८फउफफऋफhफॊ खफफऔउफळE१ळऋफ फबn८E१फखऋफॊ अफफऔफE१फhbॊ६ भखफघफजजफMफऩityढऍ डrंmadraचऍ vmंkंya ikyऍ bakङऍ viनडassargaध৷৷Thus ends the twentieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Out of affection towards his son, his (king Dasaratha's) plea to Viswamitra was full of contradiction. And on hearing the king, enraged Viswamitra replied:
O king, if this act of yours is appropriate to you, I will go back (to the places) where from I came. O scion of the race of kakutstha, you have proved false to your promise. Live happily with your relatives".
At the sight of the wise sage Viswamitra seized of wrath, the entire earth shook and  devatas were gripped in fear.
Great Vasishta, an adherent of ascetic practices and steadfast (to duty), seeing that the entire world frightened addressed the king, saying:
"Born in the line of Ikshvaku, you are a veritable the second god of righteousness, firm adherent of vows auspicious and virtuous. It is not right on your part to abandon your promise.
O Dasaratha you are reputed in the three worlds as righteousminded. Do your own duty. Do not follow an unjust act which is unworthy of respect.
O Dasaratha, a promise made and not kept amounts to destruction of merits earned through previous pieties. Therefore send Rama (with him).
Trained or not in the use of arms, as long as Rama is protected by Viswamitra, just as nectar is protected by the flaming firegod rakshasas will not be able to compete with him.
This (Viswamitra) is an embodiment of righteousness and unsurpassed among the powerful. None can excel him in intellect in this world. He is the supreme refuge in austerity.
This Viswamitra knows the use of various kinds of weapons which no one knows among the animate and the inanimate in the three worlds. Nor will any one even know in future.
No gods nor sages nor asuras in rakshasas nor kinnaras nor mighty serpents nor gandharvas nor the best of yakshas (will be able to know)
All these weapons were given to Viswamitra by Bhrisasva's highly virtuous sons while he was ruling the kingdom.
Grandsons (daughter's sons) of Prajapati, they (these weapons) are in diverse forms, highly energetic and full of glory they bring victory.
Jaya and Suprabha of slender waists are the two daughters of Daksha. They gave  birth to one hundred effulgent sons known as astras and shastras.
Formerly Jaya, for the destruction of the army of asuras gave birth to fifty sons by virtue of a boon. They  possess immeasurable power of changing forms at will.
Suprabha gave birth to another fifty sons named Samharas who are unassailable,  invincible and more powerful.
Viswamitra is well conversant with these weapons. Being virtuous, he is capable of creating new weapons also.
Such is the prowess of Viswamitra who is a highly effulgent and highly renowned  sage. O King in sending Rama, you need not entertain any doubt.
Son of Kusika, even though capable of repressing those rakhsasas by himself, it is for the welfare of your son that he is here requesting you to spare him".
Satisfied in his mind at the words of the sage (Vasishta), the full one among the Raghus' (Dasaratha) one with wide reputation, his frame shining gave his cheerful consent to the son of Kusika for Rama's departure.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकविंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Vasishta having said thus, king Dasaratha, with cheerful countenance summoned Rama and Lakshmana.
Rama was given farewell by his parents with recitation of mantras (for securing prosperity and averting evils). Priest Vasishta sanctified him with mantras Dasaratha kissed his son on the forehead and delivered him to the care of Viswamitra, with a heart full of cheer.
At the sight of the lotuseyed Rama accompanying Viswamitra, the wind blew pollenfree with a gentle touch.
The departure of glorious Viswamitra was greeted with incessant showers of flowers, the beating of celestial drums and the blowing of conches.
Viswamitra walked in the forefront. Behind him was Rama, bow in hand, while in the archer, Sumitra's son (Lakshmana) with side locks of hair followed.
Rama and Lakshmana equipped with bows and quivers resembled three hooded serpents. Warriors of no less prowess, they illuminated the ten quarters and followed the high souled Viswamitra like twin Aswanikumaras  following the grandsire, Brahma.
Then bows in hand, wellattired, their fingers encased in mongrel skin, for protection (against the bowstring) armed with scimitars, resplendent, young, handsome the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana shone unblemished. As they followed sage Viswamitra spreading radiance, they looked like sons of the god of fire, (Skanda and Visakhu) following the  incomprehensible Siva.
Then bows in hand, wellattired, their fingers encased in mongrel skin, for protection (against the bowstring) armed with scimitars, resplendent, young, handsome the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana shone unblemished. As they followed sage Viswamitra spreading radiance, they looked like sons of the god of fire, (Skanda and Visakhu) following the  incomprehensible Siva.
After crossing a distance of over half a yojana on the southern bank of Sarayu, Viswamitra addressed Rama sweet in a gentle voice.
"O child, take this water (in your hands), let there be no delay. You will receive from me a collection of mantras and also bala and atibala.
"(If you receive these mantras), you will experience neither fatigue, nor fever nor will there be a change in your appearance. Whether you are asleep or agitated, rakshasas cannot harm you.
O Rama, there is none in this world equal to the might of your hands nor does such a person exist in the three worlds.
O sinless one, there is none in this world equal to you in good fortune, kindness, wisdom, in taking a decsion or giving a reply.
With these two kinds of knowledge secured, there will be none equal to you, at present or in fututre. Bala and atibala are  mother to all kinds of knowledge .
O Rama, best among men, scion in the line of Raghu, on your way you will not feel hunger or thirst if you recite bala and atibala.
O Rama, born in the line Kakutstha and one who is righteous, these two radiant sciences are daughters of the grandsire Brahma. If you pursue these two sciences, you will get unequalled fame. You are a fit person to confer these two sciences.
You possess all these qualities in great measure. There is no doubt that If  these two sciences (mantras) are nourished with austerities they will assume multiple forms (and benefit you)".
Thereafter Rama, touched the water and was sanctified. With a cheerful face he received those two sciences from the maharshi who had perceived the supreme soul.
.Rama, the highly heroic  after acquiring knowledge (of the two sciences) and having rendered all services to preceptor Viswamitra, appeared resplendent like the Sungod in autumn. There the three of them spent the night comfortably on the bank of Sarayu.
The night was spent as though with comfort  by the two eminent sons of Dasaratha, who shared the unaccustomed bed of grass. They were kept in good humour by the words of Kusika's son.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्वाविंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana  the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When the night turned into daybreak, the eminent ascetic Viswamitra, addressing the descendants of Kakutstha (Rama and Lakshmana) who were lying on a bed of leaves said:
"O beloved son of Kausalya, O Rama the day dawns. O best among men, awake, oblations to gods and other sacred rites are required to be performed".
On hearing the very affectionate call of Viswamitra both the brave princes had their bath and offered oblations to Sungod (standing in the water) and recited the holy name of the Lord.
On performing the morning rites, the two highly powerful and and energetic princes stood before Viswamitra who was richly endowed with asceticism. They prostrated before him. And stood ready for their onward journey.
Thereafter, having gone a little further both the heroic brothers looked at the confluence of holy  Sarayu with  divine Ganga divided into three branches.
There they saw a sacred hermitage of anchorites of great vitality performing severe austerities for thousands of years.
Exceedingly delighted to see the sacred hermitage, the two princes enquired from the illustrious sage Viswamitra:
"O worshipful one, whose sacred hermitage is this? Who lives here? Indeed, we are curious to know".
On having heard their words, the foremost of sages gently smiled and said, "O Rama listen, who this hermitage belonged to in the past".
"Kandarpa (the god of love) once lived here in human form. He is called Kama by the learned. The wicked Kama on his way with the maruts (god of wind) insulted Siva, the god of gods, while he was absorbed in austere meditation along with his newly wedded consort. On seeing Kama Lord Siva roared at him (menacingly).
"O descendant of Raghu, burnt down by his fierce (third) eye, all the limbs of the body of that evilminded Kama were consumed.
Having been completely burnt down by Lord Siva, Kama's body was destroyed. Mighty angry, Siva, reduced Kama to a 'disembodied being.
O descendant of the Raghus, from that time onwards, he was known as 'Ananga' (one without form). The  beautiful place where he gave up his body is known as Angadesa.
This holy hermitage belongs to Kama. These ascetics are his disciples. They are  always righteous and are free from sin.
O auspiciouslooking Rama, we will stay here tonight at the confluence of both these sacred rivers (Sarayu and Ganga) and cross over Ganga tomorrow.
O best of men, after morning ablutions offering oblations to the sacred fire, all of us sanctified will enter this pious hermitage".
As they were conversing thus, the ascetics, with their far reaching spiritual vision (beyond the veil of time) recognised them and were immensely pleased.
After extending hospitality to the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) with respectful offerings, and water for washing feet they played the host to Rama and Lakshmana.
Having received due hospitality, they delighted them (ascetics) with their talk. The rishis with composed minds recited their evening prayer as usual.
The ascetics who resided there, faithful to their vows, took them in. There they staed happily  in Kama's hermitage.
Foremost among the ascetics the son of Kusika (Viswamitra) delighted the charming  princes with enchanting tales. इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रयोविंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thereafter the destroyers of foes, Rama and Lakshmana offering their morning oblations on that bright dawn arrived at the bank of the river (Ganga) with Viswamitra ahead of them.
All the highminded ascetics and strict followers of vows secured an auspicious boat for them and addressed Viswamitra, saying:
With the princes ahead of you, board the boat. Tread the safe path. Let there be no loss of time.
"Be it so", said Viswamitra and paid respect to all those sages. And accompanied by them (Rama and Lakshmana), crossed the river flowing towards the sea.
As they reached the midstream, Rama and his younger brother heard a sound greatly  augmented by the speed (of the river).
Rama enquired of Viswamitra, the best of sages, "What is this tumultuous sound  bursting out of the waters?"
At the words of Rama filled with curiosity, the righteous (Viswamitra) narrated the true nature of that sound.
"O tiger among men, Rama. Brahma created out of his mind a lake on mount Kailas and so that lake is called Manasa (Sarovara).
This river which flows from Manasa Sarovara is, therefore, known as 'Sarayu'. It surrounds  Ayodhya. This sacred river flows from that lake of Brahma.
When Ganga approaches this river (Sarayu), there is a clash of waters and this great noise is produced. Rama, offer respectful salutations here, with a calm mind".
Deeply religious (in nature) they both made obeisance to the two rivers and reached the southern bank and advanced with quick steps.
He who was a descendent of Ikshvaku and son of the best of kings, (Dasaratha) having seen that untrodden and dreadful forest asked the foremost of the ascetics:
"What a wonder This inaccessible forest echoes with the (shrill) chirpings of crickets It is filled with ferocious beasts and birds producing fearful sounds.
"It resounds with the frightful shricks of various kinds of birds. Lions, tigers, boars and elephants prowl about.
This forest jampacked with dhava, ashvakarna, kakubha, bilva, tinduka, patala and badari trees, how frightening this forest could be"
Viswamitra, the great sage radiating energy addressing Rama said, "O child of kakusthsa dynasty I shall tell you whose dreadful forest this is. Listen"
O best among men, formerly these two large and prosperous cities called Malada and Karusha built by celestial architects existed.
O Rama, in ancient times after killing Vritrasura, Indra was overpowered by the sin of slaying a brahmin and was affected by impurity and hunger.
Devas and rishis endowed with the wealth of asceticism bathed Indra with the (consecrated) waters (brought from all rivers) from the pitchers and got him cleansed of impurities.
With the hunger and the taint and impurity from the body of Mahendra removed at this place, the devas rejoiced.
Cleansed of his impurities and his hunger gone, Indra once again became pure. Allpowerful Indra highly pleased gave an excellent boon to that region.
Indra blessed the place saying, 'Having absorbed impurities of my body, let these places be extremely fertile and prosperous and let this be renowned throughout this world as Malada and Karusha'.
Having seen the honour bestowed on that land by the wise Indra, the gods said to him, 'Well done, Well done'.
O Destroyers of enemies these prosperous townships, Malada and Karusha looked cheerful with (bumper) crops and wealth for a long time.
Then, after a lapse of several years, O gentle one a terrible yakshini by name Tataka,  wife of intelligent Sunda, capable of assuming different forms at will, possessed of the strength of a thousand elephants and mother of a rakshasa known as Maricha armed with the power of Indra took possession of this place.
The arms (of Maricha) are round and strong. He is highly energetic. He has a large face and a huge body. In appearance, he is gigantic and possesses a dreadful form. That rakshasa always threatened the inhabitants.
"O Rama that wicked than Tataka carried on her depredations at regular intervals in these locations, Malada and Karusha.
Tataka lives at a distance of one and a half yojanas from here obstructing the path. Since Tataka dwells in this forest, no one comes here (because of fears).
"By  the strength of your arms slay this one of wicked deeds. Comply with my orders and make this country safe (and habitable).
O Rama none dare approach this country ravaged by such dreadful, intolerable yakshini.
You have been told the manner in which this fierce forest is entirely ruined by that cruel yakshini. Tell now she has not left this place".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुर्विंशतिस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing the excellent words of Viswamitra, a sage with unimaginable faculty. Rama, the tiger among men (Rama) replied in a, gentle voice:
"O best of ascetics, I have heard the yakshas possess little prowess. How can a woman who is by gender weak possess the strength of a thousand elephants?
Viswamitra said, "Listen, how she acquired the prowess and strength by virtue of a boon she received.
"In the past there was a powerful and great yaksha by name Suketu. He had no  children. So he performed an intense penance following virtuous practices.
Rama the grandsire Brahma was highly gratified and granted to the king of yakshas, the gem of a daughter by name known asTataka.
The illustrious grandsire Brahma granted her the strength of a thousand elephants, but did not bestow a son on the yaksha.
As she grew up, glowing with youth and beauty she was given in marriage to Sunda, son of Jharjha.
After some time that yakshini gave birth to an unassailable son by name Maricha. Because of a curse, he became a rakshasa (though born of yaksha parentage).
O Rama when Sunda died Tataka along with her son wanted to attack Agastya, the best of sages.
Roaring, she rushed with excitement to devour him. The venerable  rishi Agastya saw her approaching him and cursed Maricha to assume form of a demoness.
Mighty angry, Agastya cursed Tataka saying, 'Abandon this form of a great yakshini and assume the terrible figure of a rakshasi, a cannibal with distorted appearance and a hideous countenance'.
Enraged at the curse, senseless, Tataka with anger, has been ravaging this sacred land when Agastya walked.
O Rama for the welfare of cows and brahmins, slay this yakshini who is wicked, extremely cruel and possessing vile prowess.
O son of Raghu's dynasty she is maligned by the curse, and so not a single man in the three worlds except you, is  competent to slay this yakshini.
O best among men you need not hate killing a woman. You are a prince. You should serve the interest of the four orders of the society.
Whether cruel or kind, sinful or wrong whatever contributes to the protection of the subjects, should be done by the righteous (king).
This is the eternal law binding those who are appointed to bear the burden of a kingdom. O Kakutstha kill her. She knows no dharma.
O Prince It is heard that in the past Indra slew Manthara, Virochana's daughter who intended to destroy the earth.
O Rama in olden times, the mother of Kavya and the wife of sage Bhrigu, determined to make this world devoid of Indra was destroyed by Visnu.
O Prince by these magnanimous persons and by great men several unrighteous women were killed for the common good".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चविंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
After listening to the manly command of ascetic Viswamitra, Rama, of the lineage of Raghu, the son of the foremost of men and firm in determination, replied with folded palms:
In Ayodhya in the presence of elders and spiritual masters (of Dasaratha's court), I have been ordered by my magnanimous father to act according to your instructions  and his words cannot be disobeyed.
As per the words of my father and the command of Viswamitra, who has the knowledge of the Brahman,  I shall execute the welcome act of killing Tataka.
For the welfare of cows and brahmins and also for the good of this country, I am ready to perform such acts as commanded by you of  boundless energy".
Rama, the destroyer of enemies having said so clinched the middle of the bow with his fist and filled the ten quarters with the resounding twanging of the bowstring.
The dwellers of the Tataka forest were terrified by the sound (of the bow). Tataka, was might angry and amazed.
Hearing that sound, the demoness thought for a while and senseless with anger  rushed in the direction where the sound had come from.
Filled with wrath Rama saw Tataka, disfigured with a distorted face and gigantic in size. Turning to Lakshmana he said :
"O Lakshmana, behold, the sight of the dreadful hideous body of this yakshini will break timid hearts.
See, she is unassailable because of the strength gained through black magic. I shall cut off her ears and the tip of her nose and make her turn away.
By virtue of being a woman, she is protected. I am not inclined to slay her but take away her prowess and power of motion".
While Rama was still speaking, Tataka, incensed with fury rushed with her uplifted arms towards him roaring.
Brahmarshi Viswamitra threatened her with hunkara (menacing sound), uttering, "Auspices to the Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) be aupicousness and success" victorious.
Tataka raising a cloud of frightening dust left the descendants of Raghu bewildered quite for a moment.
Then invoking the power of magic, she showered extensive rain of boulders on both the descendants of Raghu. Rama was enraged at this.
Rama retaliated that mighty rain of rocks with a volley of arrows. While she was advancing towards him, he cut off her hands.
When she was tired and roaring in a nearby place with her hands chopped off, Lakshmana cut off her ears and the tip of her nose in indignation.
Capable of assuming forms at will, that yakshini intending to delude the princes through her power of magic, vanished from the sight. She then assumed various forms and released a rain of rocks. And started moving about frightfully.
On seeing them hit and thrown about by a rain of stones from all sides, the  auspicious son of Gadhi, (Viswamitra) spoke these words:
"O Rama she does not deserve any more compassion. This yakshini who is sinful, wicked and obstructor of sacrifice will regain her strength by her magical powers ".
Kill her, for dusk is fast approaching. During evening the strength of rakshasas tends to increase and they become unassailable".
Addressed thus (by Viswamitra), Rama attacked her exhibiting his skill in targetting her by the sound and prevented with arrows the yakshini from showering  stones.
.Prevented by a multitude of arrows, she with her magical powers, advanced towards Rama and Lakshmanaroaring.
Her chest pierced with an arrow, she rushing menacingly towards them like a thunderbolt fell down dead.
Having seen the slain yakshini of terrible appearance, Indra and other celestials worshipped Rama, exclaiming "well done, well done ".
Then exceedingly pleased the thousandeyed Indra and all other delighted celestials  said to Viswamitra:
"O ascetic Kausika, may prosperity be to you All devatas have been gratified by this act (of Rama) and have expressed their love for Rama.
"O Brahmarshi, you may offer to Rama, the sons of  Prajapati Brishasva who are the weapons bestowed with the power that comes from truth and ascetic energy".
"O Brahmarshi following you with firmness of mind, Rama is worthy to receive the weapons. He who is a prince has to accomplish many such great tasks for the benefit of the celestials".
Having said these words, the celestials were pleased. They honoured Viswamitra and returned to their abodes from where they had come. And then dusk set in.
Then, the best of ascetics Viswamitra rejoiced over the death of Tataka, kissed the forehead of Rama (fondly) and spoke these words:
"O auspiciouslooking Rama tonight we shall stay here. Tomorrow morning we proceed to my hermitage".
Having heard the words of Viswamitra, Rama rejoiced and rested happily that night in the Tataka forest .
Freed from the curse from that day that forest looked charming and shone like Chitraratha Kubera's (garden).
Rama having killed the daughter of yaksha was praised by multitudes of devatas and siddhas. He stayed in the same forest with the sage. At the first glimpse of dawn, he was awakened by the sage (Viswamitra).इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षड्विंशस्सर्ग:।।7Thus ends the twentysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The night over, illustrious Viswamitra called Rama with a sweet smile.
"O prince of great renown, I am extremely pleased. May you prosper Out of great love and affection for you I shall make over all the weapons.
With the help of these celestial weapons, you will vanquish even gods and demons, serpents together with gandharvas if they challenge you to a battle as enemies and take them as captives. I shall confer on you all such weapons. May you prosper
Mighty armed, heroic Rama I shall grant you the great celestial dandachakra. O best among men I shall grant you dharmachakra, kalachakra, visnuchakra, indraastra, vajraastra and the great, trident of Siva, brahmashirastra, ishika astra and highly superior brahmaastra.
Born in the race of kakutstha and a tiger among men, O Rama I shall also grant two  shining maces known as modaki and shikhari.
Rama, I shall grant dharmapasa, kalapasa, varuna pasa, too unique weapons.
O descendant of Raghu I shall grant you two thunderbolts named shuska and ardra (dry and wet), painaka astra and narayanaastra.
O blemishless Rama I shall grant you agneyaastra known as sikhara which is my favour weapon and vayavyaastra  known as prathana৷৷
O Rama bron in the Kakutstha race, I shall grant you two powers named hayasira (Horse head) and kraunchaastra.
I shall grant all these weapons, the dreadful kankala, pestle kapala and kankana used by asuras.
O mightyarmed prince, I shall grant mahaastra, vaidyadhara and and an excellent scimitar  known as nandana.
Rama, I shall grant two much favoured weapons namely gandharvaastras, manava  astra, which induce and suppress sleep and sauraastra as well.
O renowned prince, best among men, receive these astras known as darpana, soshana, santhapana, vilapana, madana astra, the unassailable one favoured by kamadeva  and the paisacha astra known as mohana favoured by demons.
O tiger among men mighty prince, accept tamasa and saumanaastras, the unassailable, samavardha weapon, mausala, satyaastra, the supreme mayadhara astra, the terrible tejaprabhaastra capable of removing the energy of the opponent, a soft weapon called sisira, supremely formidable twashtus astra, Bhaga's terrible shiteshuastra (sharp arrowed one) and manava astra.
O Rama mightyarmed prince, receive these mighty and highly exalted  astras capable of assuming at once any form at will".
Viswamitra, the greatest ascetic after the purification ritual stood with his face turned  east and happily, conferred on Rama collection of the unique mantras.
The sage offered Rama the complete collection of those weapons which even the celestials find it difficult to acquire.
While the sagacious ascetic Viswamitra was muttering the mystic terms of these venerable astras (addressing their respective deities), all these weapons (with their mystic power) attended on Rama.
The munificient presiding deities of the weapons with folded palms addressed these words to Rama saying, "Here we are, at you disposal ".
Rama received the astras he felt with his hands and commanded them saying, "Live in my mind" (serve me whenever I remember you).
Thereafter, the cheerful Rama, bowed to the mighty ascetic Viswamitra and commenced his journey.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तविंशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the twentyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
After performing the purificatory rites, Rama received the weapons with a cheerful face. In the way Rama said to Viswamitra.
"O venerable one, having received these weaponsI have become unassailable even by the celestials. O best of ascetics, May I know the way to withdraw these weapons".
To these words spoken by Rama, maharshi Viswamitra who was patient practitioner of vows and pure taught the withdrawl mantra.
"O Rama the descendant of Raghu, receive from me the effulgent weapons who are the sons of Bhrusasva and who are capable of changing forms at will. They are  Satyavanta, Satyakirti, Dhrishta, Rabhasa, Pratiharatara, Paranmukha (turned back wards), Avanmukha (turned downwards), Lakshaksha, Vishama, Drudhanabha and Sunabha, Dasaksha, Satavaktra, Dasasheersha and Satodara, Padamanabha and Mahanabha, Dundunabha and Sunabhaka, Jyotisha, Krusanam, both Nairasya and  Vimala, Yogandhara, Haridradaitya, Prasamana, Sarchirmali, Dhri, Mali, Vrtiimanta, also Ruchira, Pitrusaumanasa, bothVidhuta Makara, Karaveera Kara, Dhana, Dhanya, Kama Roopa, Kamaruchi, Moha, also Avarana, Jrumbhaka, Sarvanabha, also Santhana and Varuna. You are worthy of receiving these weapons. May you prosper.

You are worthy of receiving these weapons. May you prosper.
"Certainly" said Rama, and with a delighted heart received the astras. Some of the astra devatas were coat black, some like smoke, some resembled rays of Sun or Moon. Assuming corporal forms, with shining, divine bodies, those weapons the their bodies bent down and palms folder they spoke to Rama in a gentle voice: "O tiger among men, here we are, What can we do for you"?
Rama spoke to them (astra devatas) saying, "Reside in my mind and render assistance  in times of need. Now you can go according to your will".
Thereafter those devatas having said, "Be it so", circumambulated Rama, took leave of him and returned to their respective abodes from where they had come.
After having acquired the knowledge of the weapons Rama addressed maharshi Viswamitra in gentle and soft words while walking along with him.
"From this side of the mountain, not  faroff from here stand shining and goodlooking trees resembling clouds. It is replete scattered with animals, pleasing to the mind and extremely beautiful. It is adorned with various kinds of birds singing sweetly. What could be this? I am very curious to know.
O best of acetics, I think we have come out of that  awesome (horripilating) forest because of the pleasant feeling experienced in this region. Whose hermitage is this? O Revered one tell me".
O great ascetic, O venerable brahmana, from where do those slayers of brahmanas, doers of cruel acts, wickedminded and sinful persons come from and cause obstacles to your sacrifice? Where is that sacrificial place required to be protected by me? Where are these rakshasas required to be slain? O best of ascetics, I would like to hear from you". इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे अष्टाविंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The highly lustrous Viswamitra heard the words of Rama of immeasurable prowess. On his (Rama's) query about the forest, Viswamitra explains.
"O mightyarmed Rama Lord Visnu, the foremost among the gods, and master the great ascetic lived here carrying out yogic practices and penance for innumerable years  constituting hundreds of yugas.
"O Rama this was the hermitage of glorious Vamana. The great sage her performed his ascetic pratices here, hence it is known as siddhashrama.
"During the period Visnu (in the incarnation of Vamana) was observing austerities at this hermitage, king Bali, son of Virochana, having vanquished Indra and maruts and devatas ruled this kingdom and became famous in all the three worlds (for his prowess and generosity.)
"While Bali was performing the sacrifice (to confirm his position as lord of the three worlds), the devas got together with Agni in the forefront and approached Lord Visnu at this hermitage, saying:
'O Visnu son of Virochana is performing a great sacrifice. Before its completion, our purpose ought to be achieved'.
'He is granting the seekers whatever, wherever and in whichever maner they, coming from here and there approach him for favour'.
"O Visnu perform this supreme, auspicious act assuming the form of a dwarf through, the power of illusion for the welfare of the devatas'.
"O Rama in the mean time revered Kasyapa resplendent like the god of fire radiating lustre with Aditi who had completed a thousand divine years of austerities pleased (with her penance) the conferer of boons, Lord Madhusudana" (Visnu) (And she said to Visnu):
"You are all ascetism, a mass of tapas, and an embodiment of tapas. Your soul is tapas. O Purushottama I am beholding you after a rigorous penance.
"O Lord I am beholding this entire universe in your body. You are beginningless and  indescribable. I take refuge in you".
Addressing Kasyapa whose sins had been washed clean, Lord Visnu pleased (with his penance) said: "Be prosperous you are dear to me. Worthy of a boon. Ask."
Having heard those words of Vishnu, Kasyapa, son of Maricha, replied, "O bestower of boons, O great practitioner of austerities Be pleased to grant a boon for Aditi, devatas and for myself.
"O Sinless Lord, Be born son to Aditi and to me, O Destroyer of asuras, be the younger brother to Indra. You can help these sorrowstricken devatas.
O Lord of the celestials, with my penance accomplished (here) this place will be known as siddhaashrama by your grace. O Lord arise from here".
Then the resplendent Visnu, born from the womb of Aditi and assuming the form of Vamana, approached, the son of Virochana (Bali).
Thereafter, Visnu, soul of the universe who restores respect (for the righeous), and renders the welfare of all living beings, having begged from Bali, and been granted three places to put his footsteps on occupied the (three) worlds and by restraining Bali with his energy, gave (it) back to Mahendra. In this manner the highly lustrous Visnu, gave  possession of the three worlds to Mahendra.
"This asrama, which relieves fatigue, previously under the possession of Vamana, has come under my occoupation for my devotion to him.
"O tiger among men, wicked rakshasas who prowl about the asram and cause obstacles ought to be killed here only.
"O Rama, now let's go to the unparalleled Siddhashrama. O child this asrama is the same to you as it is to me (treat this as your own)".
While enetering the hermitage the great ascetic appeared resplendent (in the company of Rama and Lakshmana) like the moon in conjunction with Punarvasu star emerging out of  the mist.
At the sight of Viswamitra all the ascetics, inmates of Siddhashrama, jumped out instantly and offered him their worship.
They extended hospitality to both the princes in the same way they offered their worship to the sagacious Viswamitra.
The two princes of the lineage of Raghu, destroyers of foes rested a while and then said to Viswamitra, a tiger amon sages:
O foremost of ascetics Get initialed today. You will prosper and this asram will attain its fulfilment. Your words shall come true.
Saying this, Viswamitra, the great saint effulgent and self trained engaged himself in the  initiation ceremony.
The two princes spent the right comfortably and woke up at daybreak. They  performed morning in accordance with the prescribed rule, ablutions, said their prayers and paid their respects to Viswamitra seated at the kindled firesacrifice.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनत्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the twentyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thus spoke the two princes to Viswamitra. They were conscious of place and time to speak and capable of conquering enemies.
"O adorable Brahmarshi, we want to know around what time the rakshasas will make their appearance so that the sacrifice can be protected. Let  not that moment pass".
The sages (of the asrama) were very pleased. They extolled the princes of Kakustha dynasty, who were eager to fight the rakshasas.
"O sons of Raghu's lineage protect the sacrifice for six nights from today. With the ceremoney initiated, the sage would  observe silence said the inmates".
At these words of the sages the illustrious princes got ready to protect the tapovana for six days and six nights without sleep.
The two mighty, heroic archers (Rama and Lakshmana), destroyers of enemies attended upon the sacrifice in order to protect sage Viswamitra.
Time passed. When the sixth day arrived Rama cautioned Lakshmana to be vigilant.
While he was fracing up for a fight, the fire on the sacrificial altar with the officiating priests and spiritual guides suddenly brightened.
The altar with Viswamitra and the officiating priests, kusa grass, ladles and square vessels, bundles of sticks and  flowers, (used in the sacrificfial fire) got brightened up.
While the sacrifice was being performed in accordance with mantras, a great sound causing fear emerged from the sky.
Like the clouds in the rainy season, the two rakshasas (Maricha and Subahu), covering the sky through their power of illusion, came running (to the sacrificial place).
Maricha and Subahu of fearful appearance arrived with their followers and rained streams of blood (on the sacrificial altar).
Flames rose on the sacrificial altar drenched by the stream of blood. Immediately Rama rushed forward and beheld them in the sky.
Having seen them (Maricha and Subahu) suddenly advancing the lotuseyed Rama gazed at Lakshmana and said:
"O Lakshmana, behold, by manavaastra I shall chase, like clouds scattered by winds those wicked rakshasas who eat human flesh".
The inflamed Rama hurled the highly powerful and effulgent Manavaastra on the chest of Maricha.
Smitten by that powerful Manavaastra, Maricha was thrown to a full distance of hundred yojanas into the surging high seas.
Having seen Maricha beaten by the power of that coolarrowed astra, thrown to a distance, reeling and lying unconscious, Rama spoke to Lakshmana:
"O Lakshmana behold this Manavaastra associated with righteousness employing a cool arrow, which carries him away by making him unconscious and yet not taking his life.
"I shall slay these merciless, wicked doors of sinful acts destroyers of sacrifices and blood rakshasas".
Then Rama took hold of the celestial, marvellous Agneya weapon and hurled it into the chest of Subahu. Struck, Subahuhe fell down on the ground.
Illustrious and highly generous Rama killed the  remaining rakshasas  with the Vayavya weapon to the delight of the ascetics.
Having killed the rakshasas, obstructors of sacrifices, Rama was worshipped by the hermits like Indra was honoured in the past when he was victorious.
Thereafter, when the sacrifice was completed, maharshi Viswamitra beholding all the directions  bereft of evils, said to Rama:
There, with their purpose fulfilled the heroes, Rama and Lakshmana, full of joy in their hearts spent the night.
As the night dawned, both the brothers performed the morning rites and approached Viswamitra and other rishis.
Sweettongued, they visited with folded hands the best of ascetics Viswamitra who was shining like a flaming fire and addressed him  thus in sweet and generous words:
"O tiger among ascetics, we  two are at your  service. Command whatever you want and we shall execute" it.
Addressed, thus by both of them, Viswamitra ahead of all the sages, spoke to Rama.
"O foremost of men, Janaka, king of Mithila, is performing a great religious sacrifice. We shall go there.
O tiger among men, come along with us. You ought to see there the wonderful  jewel of a bow.
O best among men, this bow of immeasurable energy. dreadful and highly lustrous was bestowed on king Janaka by devatas in a sacrificial  assembly in the past.
Neither devas, nor gandharvas, nor asuras nor human, are capable of stringing the bow by any means.
Mighty princes and kings have failed to string it, in their attempt to know its strength.
O best of men, O descendent of Kakustha, there you will see the bow that belongs to the magnanimous king of Mithila and the wonderful sacrifice at that place.
O best among men, that excellent bow strong in the middle was offered by king of Mithila, Devarata as well as by all devatas as fruit of the sacrifice.
O Rama, that bow is worshipped in the king's palace as principal deity with various kinds of perfumes, sandal paste, incense and fragrant agaru".
Having spoken thus, Viswamitra,  the best of ascetics commenced the onward journey along with the Kakutshas and rishis, taking leave of the deities of the forest.
"(O ascetics of the forest) May you be safe. My purpose has been achieved in this Siddhaashrama. From here I shall go to the Himavanta mountain situated on the northern bank of  Jahnavi" (said Viswamitra).
Thereafter, circumambulating the supreme Siddhasrama with reverence, they (Viswamitra and the princes) commenced their journey in the northern direction.
As Viswamitra, the best of ascetics set out on his journey, expounders of the Vedas followed him, nearly in one hundred carriages.
Birds and beasts living in Siddhaashrama also followed the illustrious maharshi Viswamitra over a long distance until he sent them back.
The sages travelled a long distance and halted on the bank of  Sona at sunset.
The sages who possessed great splendour bathed and offered oblations to fire at sunset and sat in front of  Viswamitra.
Rama together with Lakshmana having offered respectful salutations to the sages, sat in front of the sagacious Viswamitra.
Thereafter highly lustrous Rama, the best among men, filled with curiosity enquired of the great sage Viswamitra:
"O worshipful one, what could be the reason for this region shining with luxuriant groves?  I wish to hear from you. You can tell me all about this (region). May it be safe for you"
A sage of  excellent vows and rigid austerities, Viswamitra, urged by the words of Rama, described  in the midst of rishis the entire story relating to that region.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकत्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
There was a great ascetic named Kusa, born to Brahma, as ascetic indefatigable in vows, knowldegeable in dharma and a respector of the virtuous.
That great soul, Kusa, married the princess of Vidarbha  born in a noble family and a match for him. He begot four virtuous sons who resembled him. They were Kusamba, Kusanabha, Adhurtarajas and Vasu.
Kusa addressed his four brilliant sons who were highly enthusiastic, pious, truthful and were wedded to duties of the warrior race:
"O my sons, govern with righteousness so that you will acquire immense merit'. Hearing the words of the rishi, the four sons who were the best among men and revered in the world constructed four cities as their abodes.
The brilliant Kushamba and the righteous Kushanabha constructed the cities of Kaushanbi and Mahodaya (as their capital) respectively.
O Rama king Adhurtarajasa constructed Dharmaranya, the best of cities and king Vasu, the city of Girivrajam.
O Rama this place where we are (called Vasumati) belongs to the magnanimous king Vasu. This is  surrounded by five great shining mountains.
The delightful and renowned river Sumagadhi (known as Sona), flowing in the country of Magadha, looks beautiful like a garland amidst five great mountains.
Rama, this Magadhi river, of great Vasu flows from the east surrounded by fertile crops fields like a garland.
O scion of the Raghu family, the virtuous rajarshi Kusanabha begot one hundred beautiful daughters through a nymph named Ghritachi.
Those welladorned, beautiful, young maidens in the pleasuregarden looked like lightnings in the rainy season. Bedecked with fine ornaments they were singing, dancing, playing on instruments and moving in all directions in great delight.
With beautiful limbs of unparalleled beauty on earth, they shone in the pleasuregarden like stars in the midst of clouds.
At the sight of the maidens embellished with all virtues and youth and beauty, the allpervading Windgod addressed them these words:
I request you all to be my wives. You will leave this feeling of mortality and attain a long life.
Youth is always unstable, especially in human beings. If you marry me, you will be ever youthful like devatas.
At the works of the untiringly blowing Windgod the lunged maidens laughed and said:
"O best among devatas you move within all living beings, we feel your impact. Why do you insult us?
"O best among devatas we are daughters of Kusanabha, We are capable of pulling you down from your position. We are safeguarding our ascetic merit as virgins (we could curse you to save our ascetic merit)" of Kusnabha.
O wicked one, do not dishonour our father who always speaks the truth. He will choose the bridegrooms righteously. Do not invite death (father may be the cause of your death).
Our father is our lord. Our father is god to us. Whomsoever our father offers us shall become our husband".
Having heard the words of those maidens, the most powerful and venerable Windgod became furious. He entered all the limbs of their bodies, twisted and distorted them.
Their bodies disfigured and shattered by the Windgod, the maidens with tears flowing from their eyes entered the palace and fell down on the ground, agitated and overtaken by shame.
The king saw his extremely beautiful beloved daughters distressed and shattered and spoke these words with bewilderment.
"O daughters What has happened? Who has dishonoured virtue? Say it at once. Who has made you hunchbacked? Standing roud me, why are you dumb?" The king heaved a sigh and entered into a state of samadhi.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्वात्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing the words of sagacious Kusanabha, his hundred daughters touched his feet  with their heads and  said:
"O king, the  allpervading Windgod, having taken recourse to foul means intended to outrage our modesty without and moral compunction.
We have our father who is dear to us. Hence we do not have freedom to choose. You may ask our father if he is willing to give us (in marriage).
As all of us were speaking thus, the sinful Windgod, disregarding our words repeatedly assaulted us.
The deeply religious and highly powerful king, having heard those words of his one hundred exceptional daughters, replied:
"O daughters you have done a great act of forgiveness of which only the tolerant are capable. By taking a united stand, you have protected the honour of my dynasty.
Whether for women or men forgiveness is an ornament. It is difficult even for gods. For you, daughters, to show it without any difference of opinion is especially hard.
"Forbearance is charity, forbearance is sacrifice, forbearance is truth, forbearance is glory and forbearance is virtue. O daughters, the universe is supported by forbearance".
"O Rama after sending away his daughters, the king endowed with the power of the celestials and wellversed in the art of counselling, consulted his ministers about a suitable person for marriage of his daughters at proper time and place.
At that time a great and virtuous ascetic named Chuli living in celebacy was performing austerities in pursuit of the knowledge of Brahman.
When he was performing austerities, a nymph named Somada, daughter of Urmila, used to serve him. Prosperity to you
Somada rendered her services with devotion and humility. There she lived a religious life. In the might time her spiritual guide was satisfied with her services.
When her services came to a fruition with the passage of time, maharshi Chuli, spoke to her: 'I am pleased with you. What favour shall I do for you? May you be prosperous'
Having perceived that the sage was satisfied, the gandharva who was skilled in speech said exceedingly delighted to the sage in a sweet voice.
Bestowed with the great asceticism and brilliance of a brahmin, you look like Brahma. O righteous one, I desire a son endowed with the ascetic virtues of a brahmin.
I am without a husband, my sire. I am not a wife to any one. Since I have taken refuge in you, you are competent to bestow on me a son with the power of your penance".
Pleased with her, brahmarshi Chuli gave her an excellent son to be wellknown as Brahmadatta born through the will of his mind.
Then king Brahmadatta, son of Somada, lived in the city of Kampilya with great prosperity like Indra in heaven.
O Rama, then the highly righteous king Kusanabha decided to give his hundred daughters to Brahmadatta".
The lord of the earth, highly powerful king Kusanabha invited Brahmadatta, and gave his hundred daughters in marriage to him with a heart highly pleased.
O son of Raghu's dynasty that king Brahmadatta resembling Indra received the hands of those maidens' in due order.
Thereafter, with the mere touch of his hand, the hundred daughters were cured of their hump back and freed from anguish. They assumed great beauty.
King Kusanabha, having seen his daughters released from disfigurement caused by  the Windgod was immensely pleased. He experienced waves of delight.
Then the king along with his queens performed the marriage of his daughters in the assembly of priests and sent them with Brahmadatta (to his kingdom).
Somada the gandharvi was exeedingly delighted with her daughtersinlaw and praised her son for his right action.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डेण्डे त्रयस्त्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O son of Raghu's dynasty (Rama) Brahmadatta got married and left for his kingdom. Now a putreshti was performed by king Kusanabha in order to beget a son.
Then, while putreshti was on Kusa the highly generous son of Brahma, said to king Kusanabha :
"O son, a highly virtuous son named Gadhi, similar to you will be born. Because of him you will obtain everlasting fame throughtout this world".
"O Rama so saying to king Kusanabha, Kusa left through space for the eternal   Brahmaloka".
After some time, a supremely righteous son by name Gadhi was born to the sagacious Kusanabha.
O son of Raghu's dynasty the highly virtuous Gadhi is my father. I am known as Kausika being born in the family of Kusa.
O Raghava adherent of best religious practices, is my elder sister well known by name Satyavati. She was bestowed in marriage to Richika.
Following her husband my highly generous sister reached heaven with her human body and down assuming the form of a sacred river, flowed Kausiki.
Conferring the benefit of the other world and worldly pleasures on men my sister  Kausiki who is divine and beautiful having sacred waters took resort in Himavat mountain and started flowing from there.
O son of the Raghus', from then onwards with affection towards my sister Kausiki, I am  living happily in the vicinity of Himavat mountains.
Satyavati is sacred, firmly established in truth and righteousness. She is chaste holy and best among rivers. She is known as river Kausiki.
Rama, for the sake of  observance of austerity I have come to Siddhaashrama leaving her behind. Having reached here, I have fulfilled my desire through your valour.
O mightyarmed Rama since you asked me I narrated this, my origin, the history of my family and the history of this place.
O son of the Kakusthas while telling my stories, midnight has passed by. Go to sleep now. Prosperity to you. Let there be no obstacles on our way.
O son of the Raghus' the trees stand motionless, with the beasts and birds calm, all directions are pervaded with darkness.
Evening has gradually disappeared. The sky is littered with stars and planets gleaming points of light as though they are the eyes of the skies.
O Lord the Moon with his cool rays, dispelling the darkness of the earth and delighting the minds of all living beings in this world, is rising higher and higher.
All nocturnal creatures groups of yakshas and rakshasas and dreadful eaters of human flesh are moving here and there".
Having spoken thus the highly lustrous, great ascetic rested. All sages praised him, saying, "wellsaid wellsaid"
This is the family of the Kusas, venerable always devoted to dharma, foremost of men, great like Lord Brahma.
"Highly illustrious Viswamitra, you  are similar to Brahma. Among the rivers, Kausiki is the best, refurbishing the image of your dynasty".
In this way, adored by the best of ascetics, the auspicious son of Kusika, went to sleep like the lustrous Sun setting.
Rama as well as Lakshmana, with a sense of wonder went to sleep full of admiration for the great ascetic.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डेण्डे चतुस्त्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Viswamitra lay on the bank of Sona with the ascetics, for the rest of the night. (Getting up) at daybreak he said:
"Rama, the night makes way for the dawn. It is time for morning rituals. Arise, arise May the day bring good news Get ready for the onward journey".
On hearing his words Rama performed morning oblations and getting ready for the onward journey spoke:
"O knower of Brahman Clean waters of this river are adorned with sandbanks. This Sona is deep. Which way shall we cross this river?
Having been addressed by Rama thus Viswamitra said, "We shall take the way the ascetics have gone before".
With these words of the wise Viswamitra the ascetics moved forward surveying various forests.
After travelling a long distance for half a day, they saw Jahnavi, the best among rivers  haunted or worshipped by ascetics.
On seeing the river Ganga with swans and cranes floating on the surface of the  sacred waters, all the sages including the sons of the Raghus (Rama and Lakshmana) were delighted.
The birds had made the bank of the river their home. They (Rama and Lakshmana) took a dip and offered traditional oblations to ancestors. Thereafter they lighted the sacrificial fire and made customary offerings to the fire and partook of the nectarlike remains. With cheerful hearts they stood round the illustrious Viswamitra and entered the sacred bank of Jahnavi.
Then Rama said to Viswamitra "O venerable one I wish to know why Ganga flowing in three directions, occupy (purified) the three worlds before entering the sea, the lord of rivers?"
Prompted by Rama's words, maharshi Viswamitra started narrating the account of the birth and progress of river Ganga.
"O Rama the great mountain named Himavan is a treasuretrove of ores. He is the king of mountains. He had two daughters, unrivalled in beauty in this world.
O Rama Himavan's beloved of beautiful waist, wellknown by the name of Manorama is the daughter of Mount Meru. She is the mother to both the daughters.
O son of the Raghus this Ganga was born to Manorama as Himavan's eldest daughter. A second one  born to him was wellknown by the name of Uma.
Thereupon all the devatas desirous of deriving some advantage proposed that the eldest daughter of the king of mountains, Ganga, flowing in three directions be given to them.
In order to do good to the three worlds Himavan, rooted in dharma gifted his eldest daughter Ganga who sanctifies the whole world by flowing at her free will৷৷
The devatas having received Ganga committed to the welfare of the three worlds went back to their abodes with a sense of fulfilment in their mind.
O Delight of the Raghus The other daughter of the mountain Himavan was a maiden whose wealth was tapas. She pursued a vow and observed severe austerities.
Himavan the best of mountains gave his daughter Uma associated with severe austerities and venerated by the whole world in marriage to the unrivalled  Rudra.
O son of the Raghus Ganga, the holiest of rivers and Uma devi  are two daughters of the king of the mountains, (Himavan). They are worshipped by the entire world.
O child with a marvellous gait I have related to you about Ganga flowing across the three worlds, Ganga who reached the heaven first and all that.
The divine Ganga, daughter of Himavan, beautiful and sinless, carrying a large volume of water ascended the heavens".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चत्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
While Viswamitra preeminent ascetic among the sages was telling the story (of Ganga) to the heroic Rama and Lakshmana, they extolled it and enquired:
"O Brahman sage, this excellent story set in righteousness has been narrated by you. Since you are conversant with the details, you can befittingly tell the story in detail, pertaining to the eldest daughter of king of the mountains and the events that happened in the celestial and mortal worlds
Why does Ganga, the purifier of the worlds overflow the three paths (worlds)? O knower of dharma what deed made, Tripathaga (flowing in three directions) Ganga wellknown in the three worlds as the best (holiest) of all rivers"?
Having heard the words of the son of the Kakusthas, Viswamitra, vested with the wealth of asceticism, revealed the complete story in detail in the presence of the sages.
"O Rama, in ancient times, great ascetic the blueneck Lord Siva got married to goddess Uma charmed with her beauty he indulged in sexual enjoyment with intense  passion.
O Rama, tormentor of enemies, while Lord Siva was thus absorbed in sexual enjoyment, a hundred (celestial) years passed but no son was born to them.
"Then the devatas led by Brahma were exceedingly alarmed. 'Who will be able to bear the power of the offspring if it is born here and now', they reflected.
All devatas approached Siva and paying their obeisance said, "O God of the gods engaged in the welfare of all O Mahadeva accept our salutations Be king which you can be (if you will)".
"O best among the gods, the worlds cannot contain your energy (the son born of your energy) You may engage yourself in penance in the company of Uma in conformity with the Vedas. Retain your energy in your body for the  welfare of the three worlds."
Mahadeva, ruler of the all the worlds, having heard the words of devatas, said "Be it so" Further:
""Together with Uma I will preserve the semen in my body thereby the devatas and also the earth will have peace.
"Who will contain this exceptional vital fluid of mine if shaken from its own place? O best of devatas tell me".
Thus questioned, all the devatas replied to the bearer of the flag with bull as its symbol (Siva), saying, "The earth will contain the disturbed vital fluid".
Thus replied by the devatas, the god of the gods released his vital fluid  on earth. It pervaded the entire earth including mountains and forests.
Then, the devatas said to the firegod, "Enter this energy (creative power) related to Rudra followed by the windgod".
That energy pervaded by fire was transformed into the White Mountain. It turned the forest of reeds (Saravana) (blazing) like the fire or the Sun. From that fire was born the glorious Kartikeya.
Thereafter highly pleased with the event the devatas along with the saints worshipped Siva and goddess Uma with deep devotion.
"Rama thereafter Uma, daughter of the mountain (Himavan) with her eyes red with anger cursed all of them:
"From today onwards your wives will become childless" cursed Uma. The devatas were cursed this Even the  earth:
"O Earth you will assume many forms and become wife of many masters. O evilminded one, you did not want me to bear a son. Having been fouled as a result of my anger, you will not have the pleasure of having  a son, cursed Uma.
"The god of the gods (Mahesvara), seeing all the devatas humiliated began to depart in the westerly direction presided over by Varuna.
"Mahesvara along with goddess Uma, went north of the Himavat mountain and performed penance on a peak.
"O Rama this story of the daughter of the mountain has been narrated to you. Now listen with Lakshmana the tale of the birth of Ganga":इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्त्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
In olden days when Iswara was engaged in austerities, the devatas together with the ascetics, approached Lord Brahma for an army general.
Then led by Indra and the Firegod all devatas approached Lord Brahma, the grandsire saluted him (with folded hands) and spoke.
"O Lord in ancient times your lordship gave us an army general (at the time of creation). He is engrossed in great penance along with Uma .
"O Knower of law and order O Grandsire verily you are our supreme refuge committed to the welfare of the worlds. Tell us what we should do in this matter (now that we cannot procreate a general on account of Uma's curse)".
Hearing the words of the devatas, Brahma, the Grandsire of all the worlds consoled the devatas with sweet words, saying:
"Ganga keeps flowing in the celestial regions. Through Ganga the Firegod will beget a son who will be capable of destroying enemies. He will become the army general of the gods".
"Ganga, the eldest daughter of the king of the mountains, will tend that son of Agni. This will be totally acceptable to Uma. No doubt".
"O son of the Raghus having heard Brahma's words all the devatas considered themselves successful in their mission. They saluted him with folded hands and offered their worship.
All the devatas, went to mount Kailasa, adorned with minerals, and urged the Firegod for a son.
'O lustrous Firegod, accomplish this divine work. O god, possessed of mighty energy, release the vital fluid of Iswara in Ganga, daughter of the king of mountains.
"The Firegod gave his consent. The devatas approached Ganga and said, 'O goddess bear the energy of Siva (inyour world) since this cause is dear to the gods'.
"Hearing the words of the Firegod, Ganga assumed a divine form. Beholding her glory, the god of fire pervaded her from all sides.
O Rama then, the Firegod discharged the vital fluid of Iswara, preserved in his body, which pervaded all sides of Ganga and all her streams were filled with (the fluid).
Ganga addressing the Firegod standing ahead of all the devatas said 'O god of fire, I am incapable of holding your everincreasing splendour. The fiery fluid is burning me. My consciousness is overwhelmed'.
Thereafter the Firegod who is the partaker of oblations offered to all deities said to Ganga 'Place this embryo on this slope of Mountain Himavan'.
"O glorious, sinless one, (Rama) hearing the words of the Firegod, Ganga then expelled that resplendent embryo from her streams.
The embryo that emerged from Ganga reached the earth. It resembled the lustre of molten gold. It furned into gold auspicious, bright and pure.
There copper and iron were produced from its acidity, zinc and lead from its residue. Various minerals were formed when that embryo reached the earth.
When the embryo was placed (in Ganga) it spread on all sides of the forest on the mountain. Irradiated with lustre the forest appeared golden.
O tiger among men, O scion of the Raghus Then onwards gold which is effulgent like fire, became wellknown as Jatarupa (pure form). The grass, shrubs, creepers and trees of that forest looked golden.
Thereafter Kumara was born (out of Ganga's womb). The gods together with Indra arranged six nymphs (stars) to act  as nurses to suckle Kumara as their own offspring.
Those krittikas, having decided among themselves and having made an agreement with the gods saying 'This boy shall become a son to all of us' fed the newborn with their milk (breast milk).
Thereafter, all the gods said, 'This son shall become renowned in the three worlds as Karttikeya, (son of krittikas). There is no doubt '.
Hearing the words of the gods, the krittikas bathed the baby that descended from the womb of Ganga resembling flaming fire and shining with great beauty.
O scion of the Kakusthas, Karttikeya lustrous like flaming fire, was very fortunate Descended from the womb of the Ganga, he is named Skanda by the gods.
Then excellent milk surged in the breasts of krittikas. Assuming six mouths, he sucked the milk.
Drinking milk just for a day and with a body still tender he could vanquish hosts of demons by his inborn prowess so capable be was
With the Firegod in the forefront, all the gods assembled and installed Karttikeya, shining on unsurpassed brilliant, as commander of the gods forces.
"O Rama this story of Ganga and that of the  birth of Kumara, who was fortunate and auspicious, has been related to you in detail.
O son of the Kakusthas whosoever reveres Kartikeya on this earth with devotion and faith, shall have a long life, sons and grandsons and after death will reach the world of Skanda".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डेण्डे सप्तत्रिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the thirtyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Viswamitra, an offspring of Kusika having related the story (of Karthikeya) to the son of the Kakusthas (Rama) said again.
"In olden days there lived a brave and righteous king named Sagara who was ruler of Ayodhya. He was childless and desired to have children,
O Rama the daughter of the king of Vidarbha by name Kesini was Sagara's eldest wife who was righteous and truthful.
The daughter of Arishtanemi named Sumati was the second wife of Sagara and  none surpassed her in charm on earth.
The king (Sagara) accompanied by his wives reached Himavat mountain and engaged  himself in severe austerities on a peak called Bhriguprasravana.
When Sagara completed a hundred years in austerities, highly pleased by his performance, ascetic Bhrugu, the best among the truthful granted him a boon.
O sinless one, you will get a very great progeny, O best among men you will acquire unparalleled fame in this world.
O child, one wife will beget a son who will perpetuate your race and the other, sixty thousand sons, said Bhrugu.
Thereafter, both the daughters of the king were exceedingly delighted. Having propitiated  that magnanimous asectic both of them with folded hands in supplication, said:
O knower of Brahman which of us will beget one, and who many sons? O Brahmarshi we wish to hear. Let your words come true".
Hearing their words, highly virtuous Bhrugu made an excellent statement saying, 'In this matter, you may exercise your free will'.
'What would you wish? One son who perpetuates the race or many possessed of mighty strength endowed with fame and perseverance?' (asked Bhrugu).
"O Rama, delight of the descendants of Raghus, on hearing the words of the  ascetic in the presence of king Sagara, Kesini chose the boon to have a son who perpetuates the race.
Then, Sumati (the other wife) sister of Suparna (Garuda) obtained the boon of sixty thousand sons endowed with fame and great perseverance.
O son of the Raghus the king along with his wives, having circumambulated saint Bhrugu, bowed his head in reverence, saluted him with folded hands and returned to his capital.
After lapse of some time, the eldest wife Kesini gave birth to a son wellknown by name Asamanjasa.
O best among men, Sumati gave birth to a gourdlike foetus and when it burst open, sixty thousand sons emerged.
Nurses placed all of them in pots filled with clarified butter and fostered them. They attained adolescence after a long time.
Then, after a long time Sagara's sixty thousand sons attained beauty and youth.
O best among men, delight of the Raghus (in the mean time) sagara's eldest son  Asamanjasa, used to seize hold of children and throw them into the waters of river Sarayu. And while they were drowning, he was laughing.
Thus this son inclined towards evil and formenting the good citizens was banished (of the king) from the capital for his indulgence in malevolent acts.
Asamanjasa's son was Anshuman. He was valiant, beloved and courteous to every one in the world.
O best among men after a long time, a thought came to the mind of Sagara to definitely perform a sacrifice.
O Rama having determined to perform a sacrifice, he (Sagara) versed in the Vedas, started the initiatory rites for the sacrifice in the company of high priests".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे अष्टात्रिंशस्सर्ग: 2Thus ends the thirtyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Immensely pleased with the words of Viswamitra, to the ascetic flaming bright like fire, Rama spoke towards the end of the narration:
"O Brahman I wish to listen in detail as to how my ancestors made preparations for the sacrifice? Prosperity to you".
Viswamitra addressing the son of the Kakusthas (Rama) with a smile said, "O Rama hear in detail the story of the magnanimous king Sagara".
"Sankara's fatherinlaw named Himavan is the greatest mountain. Himavan and Vindhya came close and began looking at one another. (because both are of extreme height and in between them there was no obstruction).
"O best of men, the sacrifice took place in the region in between these two  mountains. O tiger among men the region was appropriate for conducting sacrificial acts.
"O child, O son of the Kakutsthas, the great charioteer Anshuman (who can fight with eleven thousand charioteers), wielding a strong bow  followed the  sacrificial horse (in order to protect it) in compliance with Sagara's wish.
On the concluding day of the fortnight (full moon day) while the sacrifice was being performed, Vasava (Indra) assuming the form of rakshasa, had stolen away Sagara's sacrificial horse.
O son of the Kakutsthas, when the magnanimous king Sagara's sacrificial horse was stolen away, all the high priests addressing the performer of the sacrifice said:
'O Kakutstha on this auspicious (fullmoon) day the sacrificial horse has been stolen away suddenly and forcibly. Slay the thief and bring back the horse'.
'This flaw in sacrifice will be inauspicious for all of us. Hence O king do everything which will ensure flawlessness to this sacrifice'.
Having heard the words of the officiating priests, the king (Sagara) addressed his sixty thousand sons in the sacrificial assembly, saying:
'O Best among men, O sons I do not the hand of rakshasas in this as this great sacrifice is consecrated by mantras (to prevent any interruption) and is presided over by eminent priests.
'Therefore my sons, go and search this entire earth surrounded by oceans. May you be safe'.
'O sons, acquiring yojana by yojana the length and breadth of the earth, search for the  thief of the horse. Excavate the earth till the time the horse is found. This is my command'.
'Having been initiated into the sacrifice, I, along with my grandson, Anshuman and  other spiritual preceptors will stay here till such time the horse is found. May you be safe'
"O Rama thus commanded by Sagara, the highly powerful princes with cheeful hearts departed in obedience to their father's command in quest of the horse on earth.
O Tiger among men each one of them occupying one yojana in length and breadth of ground, dug up the earth with their nails that were sharp as diamonds.
O Son of the Raghus (Rama) dreadful sounds emanated while the earth was being broken open by  ploughs and lances similar to thunderbolt.
O descendant of Raghu when the earth was being churned, an irrepressible sound of serpents, demons and rakshasas --of all creatures emerged.
O Descendant of the Raghus the heroic sons of Sagara excavated sixty thousand yojanas of earth reaching the nether world (one of the several regions below the earth).
O Foremost among men (Rama) the princes while thus excavating Jambu dweepa,  in this way filled with mountains, moved around everywhere.
Then the gods together with the gandharvas, asuras and serpents in bewildered minds approached Lord Brahma.
With highly agitated minds and meloncholic faces, all of them approached magnanimous Brahma and having propitiated him said:
O Venerable one the entire earth is being excavated by the sons of Sagara. Many great beings living in the lower worlds are being killed.
'This one  is the destroyer of our sacrifice. He  has stolen away our horse' saying so the sons of Sagara are slaying all living beings".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनचत्वारिंशस्सर्ग: ।।Thus ends the thirtyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Having heard the devatas, extremely frightened, and deprived of their sensual perception by the prowess of fate. The adorable grandsire (Brahma) replied:
'This whole earth belongs to sagacious Vasudeva. He always supports the earth assuming the form of Kapila. The princes will be burnt by the fire of his wrath.
The excavation of this earth and the destruction of the short lived sons of Sagara is predestined since eternity'.
"O Destroyer of enemies (Rama) On hearing the words of the grandsire (Brahma), the  thirtythree gods, exceedingly delighted returned the way they had come.
A sound like the resembling of thunder emanated while the earth was being riven by the noble sons of Sagara.
Afterwards, all the sons of Sagara, having riven the earth approached their father and circumamulating him said:
'The entire earth was ransacked. Mighty devatas, demons, rakshasas, pisachas, uragas and kinnaras were killed. (Yet) we could neither see the horse nor the thief of the horse. Reflect over this matter and direct us. Prosperity to you'
"O Rama incensed to fury at the words of his sons, magnanimous king Sagara replied":
Rive the earth again and excavate, capture the one who has stolen the horse and return after having accomplished the purpose.  Safety to you
Receiving the command of their father, the magnanimous Sagara, his sixty thousand sons ran towards Rasatala (nether world).
Then while they were excavating the region they beheld the elephant of the quarter named Virupaksha equal in size to a mountain, supporting the earth.
O descendant of Raghu the  mighty elephant Virupaksha was holding on its head the entire earth with its mountains and forests.
O descendant of Kakustha when that mighty elephant shakes its head for rest from weariness on certain sacred days earthquake occurs.
O Rama having circumabulated and honoured that mighty elephant, the protector of the quarter they reached the Rasatala by riving the earth.
Subsequently, having dug the eastern region, they went on to southern and dug it too. In the southern region, they beheld a mighty elephant, magnanimous Mahapadma, resembling a great mountain. To their astonishment, they saw that elephant holding the earth on its head.
Thereafter, illustrious Sagara's sixty thousand sons, having circumabulated the elephant of the western region dug up that region.
Possessed of great strength, they beheld also in the western quarter a  great elephant of the quarter named Saumanasa resembling a mountain.
Having paid homage and enquiring as to his wellbeing, they arrived at the northern  region by digging the earth.
O Rama in the northern region, they beheld an auspicious elephant named Bhadra, who was white like snow, was holding that quater.
Then all sixty thousand sons having touched the elephant and circumambulated it, penetrated the earth.
Subsequently, the sons of Sagara, having gone towards the celebrated northeastern region began to dig with wrath.
Great sons of  Sagara terribly swiftfooted and exceedingly powerful beheld the eternal Visnu in (sage) Kapila and not far away from him the horse grazing. O descendant of Raghu they all experienced unparalleled joy.
They recognised that best of horses. Their eyes were red with anger. Armed with spades, ploughshares and every kind of tree and stone and furious with wrath, they rushed towards Kapila shouting, wait, wait
'O Wickedminded one you have stolen our sacrificial horse. Know that those of us who have come here are the sons of Sagara'.
"O descendant of Raghu Kapila, having heard their words, overwhelmed with great wrath, uttered the sound "H'm".
"O Delight of the Raghus, king Sagara, realising that his sons had left long ago  said to his grandson Anshuman resplendent with his own lustre:
'You are valiant. You have acquired knowledge (in various fields). You are illustrious like  your ancestors. Pursue the track taken by your uncles and by the thief who ran away with the horse'.
'Creatures in the depths of the earth are powerful and mighty. Carry with you a bow and weapons to counter their attack'.
'Honour those who deserve it. Kill those who cause obstacles to sacrifice. Come back with your mission accomplishing. And ensure the (successful) completion of my  sacrifice'.
"Having been throughly instructed by the highsouled Sagara in this way, Anshuman  left with rapid strides carrying a scimitar and a bow.
O Best among men directed by the king (Sagara), Anshuman followed the path taken by his noble uncles into the depths of the earth.
Exceedingly valiant Ashuman beheld the elephant of the quarter worshipped by daityas, danavas, rakshasas, pisachas, birds and serpents.
Having circumambulated the elephant, he (Anshuman) enquired about his wellbeing, the where abouts of his uncles and also about the one who had stolen the sacrificial horse.
Having listened to the words of Anshuman the elephant of the quarter replied, 'O Anshuman, son of Asamanjasa having fulfilled your objective, you will go back soon with the horse'.
Having listened to the words of the elephant, Anshuman started enquring the well being of each of the guardians (elephants) of the quarters successively with due respect:
All those elephants of the quarters were knowers of the essence of words and proficient in the right use of words. Treating him kindly the elephants encouraged him saying, 'You will go back with the horse'.
Hearing their words with a quick pace where he reached the place his uncles, sons of Sagara were reduced to heaps of ashes.
Then the son of Asamanjasa, overwhelmed with sorrow and deeply distressed at their destruction, bewailed with great grief.
Possessed by grief and tears, Anshuman, that tiger among men, beheld the sacrificial horse grazing nearby.
With the intention of performing traditional funeral rites with water for the deceased princes, highly lustrous Anshuman looked around for water but could not see any reservoir of water (in the neighbourhood).
O Rama with his keen eyes, he (Anshuman) marked Suparna, the maternal uncle of his uncles, lord of the eagles (Garuda) bestowed with the swiftness of the wind.
Highly powerful Garuda, son of Vinata, addressing Anshuman said 'O Tiger among men do not grieve. This act of assasination is meant for the welfare of the three worlds'.
'Your valiant uncles have been burnt by Kapila of boundless power. O Sagcious one performing traditional rites with ordinary water is not proper'.
'O Best among men O Mightyarmed one perform  the traditional rites of your uncles with water from river Ganga, the eldest daughter of Himavat'.
Ganga, the purifier of the three worlds, will sanctify your uncles reduced to heaps of ashes. These heaps when inundated by waters of Ganga, beloved of the worlds, will take  all the sixty thousand sons to heaven.
'O Highly fortunate one O Best among men go back with that horse. O Hero It behoves of you to complete the sacrifice undertaken by  your grandfather'.
Exceedingly powerful and highly renowned Anshuman, on hearing the words of Garuda returned quickly to the capital with the horse৷৷
O Descendant of the Raghus (Rama), having reached the king who had been initiated into the ceremony, Anshuman communicated faithfully to him all that had happened. He also reported the words Suparna had said.
The king heard (was stunned to hear) the awful words of Anshuman, (yet) he performed the sacrifice in accordance with traditional scriptures and Kalpa, the Vedanga.
The great lord of the earth (king Sagara) after performing the sacrifice reached his capital. (But) He could not devise any means to bring Ganga down to the earth.
The mighty king (Sagara), over a long period of time without being able to devise means (to bring Ganga down to the earth), ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years and ascended to heaven". इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकचत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fortyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rama when Sagara died, the subjects installed the highly virtuous Anshuman as king.
O descendnt of the Raghus that Anshuman became a very great monarch. He had a great son, Dilipa who became famous.
O Delight of the Raghus having vested the kingdom with Dilipa, Anshuman performed rigid penance on the sacred peak of the Himavat mountain.
O Rama highly renowned Anshuman, having lived for thirtytwo thousand years in the  tapovana, turned an ascetic and attained heaven (without accomplishing his objective).
When exceedingly brilliant Dilipa heard about the death of his grandfathers, he was overtaken by grief but could not arrive at any conclusion with his intellect (regarding means of bringing down the sacred river).
How to bring about the descent of Ganga? How to perform funeral rites of the ancestors with Ganga water? How to liberate them Thus Dilipa was constantly engaged in such thoughts.
As Dilipa known for his knowledge of the soul constantly reflected righteously on (this matter of Ganga), a highly virtuous son named Bhagiratha was born to him.
Most brilliant king Dilipa ruled the kingdom for thirty thousand years performing many sacrifices.
O Tiger among men king Dilipa was unable to arrive at a conclusion regarding the salvation of his ancestors.He was affected by illness and died.
The king (Dilipa) performed the coronation of his son Bhagiratha and reached the region of Indra as a reward for virtuous acts done by him.
O delight of the Raghus righteous Bhagiratha who was highly lustrous rajarshi was without sons. He was desirous of progeny but did not beget children.
O son of the Raghus (Rama), Bhagiratha, with a determination to bring down Ganga  entrusted the kingdom to his ministers and went to a sacred place known as Gokarna. There with arms uplifted surrounded by four fires, partaking food once a month, with his senses controlled, carried out panchatapa for a number of years.
O mightyarmed, (Rama) Bhagiratha continued in that state for a thousand years amidst rigid austerities. Lord of  all creatures, Brahma was highly pleased with that illustrious king.
Thereafter, the Grandsire arrived with the gods and spoke to the noble Bhagiratha engaged in austerities.
'O distinguished one O mighty monarch O Bhagiratha of excellent vows I am pleased with your  welldisciplined austerities. Ask for a boon'.
Brilliant, glorious Bhagiratha, stood before the Grandsire of all the worlds with folded palms and spoke":
'O Lord if you are pleased with my austerities and if they are worthy of a reward, grant me the boon whereby all the sons of Sagara will receive from me funeral rites with the waters (of Ganga)'.
'The ashes of these eminent uncles of my grandfather, immersed by the waters of Ganga may ultimately go to heaven'.
'O Lord let the progeny be perpuated in our race of the Ikshvakus. Let not that dynasty be terminated with me. This is another boon I seek'.
To this the Grandsire of all the worlds replied with a sweet voice full of good wishes and sweet words.
'O Great charioteer Bhagiratha, your desire is great. O Perpetuator of dynasty of the Ikshvakus, let your wish be fulfilled. Prosperity to you'.
'This Hymavati (Ganga) is Himavat's eldest daughter and only lord Siva is capable to hold (the force of her descent to earth). Therefore let Siva be entreated'.
'O King Ganga's descent cannot be sustained by earth. O Hero I do not see any other person to hold her than the wielder of the trident (Siva)'.
The Creator of the worlds having thus addressed the king and conversing with Ganga went towards heaven along with devatas and maruts". इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्विचत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fortysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rama when that God of the gods (Brahma) departed, Bhagiratha, pressing the earth with the tip of his big toe (standing supported by the big toe) penanced (meditated upon Siva) for one year.
After one full year was completed, Iswara who is worshipped by all in all the worlds said to king Bhagiratha:
"O Best of men  I am pleased with your devotion. I will hold Ganga on my head, the daughter of the king of mountains (to reduce  the force of her descent). I shall do your wish.
Then Ganga, the eldest daughter of Himavat who is adored by all the worlds, assuming the form of a mighty river descended from the sky with unbearable speed on the auspicious head of Siva.
"Goddess Ganga, extremely difficult to contain, thought that seizing Siva with her flow she would enter the lower regions of the earth.
Then the threeeyed Lord Siva, aware of her proud intentions applied his intelligence to conceal her.
O Rama that sacred river (Ganga), descended on to the depths of the matted locks on the holy head of Siva resembling the mount Himavan.
Trapped in the matted locks, she (Ganga) could not come out. With all her efforts she could not reach the earth.
There the golden Ganga wandered about for many years. Bhagiratha not finding Ganga, once again resorted to great penance.
O Son of the Raghus (Rama) Siva was immensely pleased with the penace and thereafter released Ganga (drop by drop) forming Bindusara.
As she (Ganga) was released, she branched out into seven streams. Three streams known as Hladini, Pavani and Nalini having auspicious waters and conferring prosperity flowed eastwards.
Auspicious Suchakshu, Sita and a great river Sindhu, these three great rivers flowed  westwards.
The seventh stream among them followed Bhagiratha. The most brilliant rajarshi Bhagiratha also mounting on divine chariot raced forward and Ganga followed him.
From the sky on to the head of Shankara and thence Ganga resorted to the earth. There it flowed forward with a roaring sound.
Then the earth looked bright with the fallen and falling shoals of fish, turtles and multitudes  of other seaanimals.
Then devarshis, gandharvas, yakshas and hosts of siddhas looked on with astonishment at Ganga falling from the sky and descending on the earth.
Then, gods in a state of excitement in their aerial chariots as large as cities, on horses and on big elephants were stationed there (in the sky).
Gods with great lustre arrived to witness the most wonderful, grand descent of Ganga.
The cloudless sky shone with the radiance of the ornaments of the gods alighting speedily to witness Ganga. It appeared as though the sky was filled with a hundred Suns.
The sky strewn with lightnings appeared as if it was inhabited by seaanimals, serpents and fishes fickle.
White foams of water were scattered in a thousand ways. It appeared as if the sky was  spread over with autumnal clouds flocks of swans.
Ganga was flowing now rapid, now slow, now wide, now meandering, now low, now high.
Sometimes waves dashed against waves. They rose repeatedly upwards and fell down on the ground.
The waters of Ganga descended on Shankara's head and from there to the earth. Freed from all impurities, the waters looked pure and clean.
Considering the waters fallen from the head of Siva sacred, devatas, rishis and gandharvas and those living on earth touched it (with reverence).
Those cursed to fall from heaven to earth were absolved of their sins after bathing there (in the waters of Ganga).
Cleansed of their sins by the sparkling waters, they ascended through the sky once again to their own (celestial) worlds.
People rejoiced at the sight of those shining waters. They were happy  to have a dip in Ganga and their fatigue was gone.
Most brilliant rajarshi Bhagiratha also mounting the divine chariot moved forward and Ganga followed him.
O Rama besides acquatic beings, rishis, devatas, daityas, danavas, rakshasas along with kinnaras, serpents, foremost of gandharvas, yakshas and apsaras all followed the chariot of Bhagiratha. They were happy to follow Ganga.
Ganga, famous and foremost of rivers, destroyer of all sins, flowed in the direction  king Bhagiratha moved.
Then while Ganga was flowing, it inundated the sacrificial ground of the great sage Jahnu. Jahnu who used to work wonders was performing a sacrifice.
O Descendant of the Raghu dynasty sage Jahnu who was performing the sacrifice, observed her pride and grew  furious. And astonishingly drank the entire waters of Ganga.
Devatas, rishis and gandharvas stood amazed (at this act). They worshipped the magnanimous Jahnu, noblest among men. The devatas entreated the illustrious Jahnu to treat Ganga as his daughter.
The brilliant (Jahnu) was pleased. He released her through both his both ears. Hence Ganga is called Jahnavi, daughter of Jahnu.
Ganga, best among rivers, following the chariot of Bhagiratha, reached the ocean. She entered the nether regions of the earth in order to fulfil his mission (salvation of the sons of Sagara).
Rajarshi Bhagiratha, having brought Ganga with supreme efforts, saw with a sad heart his grandfathers reduced to ashes.
O Best of the Raghus thereafter the holy waters of Ganga inundated those heaps of ashes and the sons of Sagara, purged of their sins, reached heaven" (said Viswamitra).इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रिचत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the fortythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thereupon that king followed by Ganga reached the ocean and entered the lower regions of the earth where the sons of Sagara were found reduced to ashes.
After the ashes were inundated by the waters of Ganga, Brahma, lord of the world,   appeared before king Bhagiratha and said:
"O Tiger among men sixty thousand sons of illustrious Sagara having been liberated, had gone towards heaven like devatas.
O King as long as the waters in the ocean exist in this world, shall the sons of Sagara, live in heavens like gods.
This Ganga will become your eldest daughter and from now on she will be wellknown in this world (as Bhagirathi) after your name.
O King divine Ganga will be called Tripathaga as well as Bhagirathi. Since she flows in the three worlds (heaven, earth and the lower world: Patala), she will be known as Tripathaga.
O Lord of men O King you may offer the waters of  Ganga here to all your ancestors and thereby fulfil your vow.
O King by the highly renowned ancestors of yours, the foremost among righteous ones (even Sagara) this desire has not been fulfilled.
O Child similarly though Anshuman possessed unparalleled prowess in this world his prayer to Ganga, his vow could not be fulfilled.
O Sinless one (Bhagiratha) O Distinguished one on the part of Dilipa brilliant your father who had the virtuous of a rajarshi, who was equal to a maharshi in splendour, and to me in austerities and abiding to the duties of a kshatriya it was even not possible to bring Ganga through prayer.
O Best among men you have fulfilled that vow. You have achieved supreme renown and reverence in this world.
O Destroyer of enemies by bringing about the descent of Ganga, you have secured a great abode in dharma.
O Best among men O Tiger among men take a dip in the eternally sacred waters,  purify yourself and acquire holiness.
O King perform the rites of all your forefathers with the waters (of Ganga), farewell. I shall return to my world (now). Go back, O King" (said Grandsire)
The illustrious rajarshi Bhagiratha, performed the rites of offering the sacred water of Ganga, in accordance with proper order and tradition for the sons of Sagara. Purified with the ablutions entered his own city." O Best of the Raghus his desire thus fulfilled he continued to rule the kingdom thereafter".
"O Best of the Raghus the world rejoiced having Bhagiratha as king. With his purpose achieved, he was freed from all mental afflictions and sorrows and thereafter lived happily.
O Rama I have related you the story of Ganga in detail. Evening time is passing by (and we shall perform the ablutions) farewell.
He will be blessed with fame, longevity, progeny and (after death) heaven brahmins One who recites this story of Ganga to the kshatriyas and others, the gods and his forefathers would be pleased with him.
O Son of the Kakusthas whosoever listens to this auspicious story relating to the descent of Ganga with concentration, all his desires will be achieved, his sins will be destroyed and his longevity and fame will increase".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुश्चत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fortyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
On hearing the words of Viswamitra, Rama along with Lakshmana, filled with astonishment said to him:
"O Knower of the Brahman this story narrated by you relating to the descent of the sacred Ganga and the fullness of the ocean  (due to Ganga's fall) is very wonderful".
Then Rama along with Lakshmana spent the whole night reflecting on the auspicious story narrated by Viswamitra.
Thereafter, the progeny of the Raghus, the destroyer of enemies (Rama) addressed Viswamitra in the clear early morning after Viswamitra had completed his routine rites:
"O Noble ascetic we have heard this great story worthy to be listened. As we both lay pondering over the entire story (narrated by you), the glorious night passed off just like a moment.
We will cross over Ganga, the best of rivers, the sacred river that flows in three directions.This boat of pious saints which is well laidout has come here swiftly, having come to know that you, O Venerable one have arrived".
Hearing the words of noble Rama, he (Viswamitra), accompanied by hosts of sages besides Rama and Lakshmana made arrangements to cross (the river).
Having reached the northern bank, they paid homage to the sages encamped on the bank of  Ganga and beheld the city of Vishala.
Thereupon Viswamitra, the best of ascetics, accompanied by Rama and Lakshmana soon proceeded towards the enchanting and splendid city of Vishala comparable to heaven.
Thereafter great intellectual, Rama, with folded palms enquired of eminent ascetic Viswamitra, about the excellent city of Vishala.
"O Distinguished ascetic, which royal dynasty is ruling this city of Vishala? Could you tell me? Great is my curiosity. May you prosper"
Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, hearing the words of Rama commenced to relate the history of the ancient city of Vishala.
"O Rama hear the auspicious legend of Indra. Listen, too, what had happened to this country.
O Blessed Rama in kritayuga, the sons of Diti were very strong and those of Aditi were spirited and righteous.
O Best among men a thought came to those illustrious ones, 'how can we be  free from old age, death and disease'?
"O Rama While the noble sons were reflecting over this matter an idea flashed across their minds to get nectar by churning the ocean of milk.
Thereupon, having decided to churn (the ocean mind) those very powerful ones, made Vasuki, (the great snake), as a rope and Mandara mountain as the churning rod.And started churning it.
After a thousand years, the hoods of the snake made as rope vomitted venom and started biting the rocks of the Mandara mountain with their teeth.
Therefrom was produced halahala, virulent venom resembling fire.The entire universe  consisting of devatas, asuras and mortals was burnt down.
The devatas sought refuge in the great god Rudra who causes happiness, the Lord of all living beings. 'Save us, Save us', the cried.
Thereupon, Hari the Lord of celestial beings extolled by the devatas appeared bearing the conch and discus.
Hari, smiling said to the tridentbearing Rudra "O Chief of celestial beings you were born the earliest among the devatas. Therefore, while churning the ocean whichever is produced first shall be offered to you. Considering it the first offering, O Lord accept this venom."
Visnu, the highest among the devatas having the spoken, vanished. Siva who had heard Visnu's words and seen the fear of the gods received that  dreadful halahala  treating it as nectar.
Lord of the gods, venerable Siva went away to his abode leaving behind the devatas. O Descendant of Raghu then all the devatas and asuras resumed churning.
'O Sinless one after the mountain (Mandara) used as churning rod sank down to nether world (patala) the devatas along with the gandharvas invoked Visnu'.
"O mightyarmed Visnu you are the ultimate refuge for all living beings, specially for the devatas. Protect us, you (alone) are fit to lift up the Mandara mountain".
Having heard these words, the controller of the sense organs, Visnu, assumed the form of a tortoise reclined in the ocean supporting the mountain on its back.
Visnu, the Supreme being, the soul of the universe standing amidst the devatas took hold of the peak of mountain with his hand and continued to churn the ocean.
In this way thousand years rolled by. In the beginining came out Dhanvantari holding a staff and a water pot (carried by ascetics) and apsaras of high lustre.
O Best among men excellent women emerged out of the essence produced by churning of waters. Therefore they are known as apsarasas.
"O Rama Diti was afflicted with great grief when her sons were killed. She addressed   her husband Kasyapa, son of Maricha", saying:
"O adorable one, your highly powerful sons, (devatas) have killed mine through extensive austerities. I am desirous of obtaining a (mighty) son capable of killing Indra.
I shall practise austerities. You ought to grant me a son who would be the supreme ruler of the world and capable of killing Indra. You can say yes (if you will)".
Then, Maricha's son, exceedingly bright Kasyapa on hearing the words of Diti who was deeply grieved replied:
"O one vested with the wealth of austerities be it so. Prosperity to you Remain chaste, you will deliver a son who will kill Indra in the battle.
"If you remain pure and clean, on completion of a thousand years you will give birth to a son through me who will be the lord of the three worlds".
Highly brilliant Kasyapa, having thus spoken, touched her gently with his palm, stroked her body and said, "May good betide thee". Having said this, Kasyapa went away to perform austerities.
"O foremost among men after Kasyapa had left, Diti exceedingly delighted (at the prospect of having sons) reached Kushaplavana, and practised intense mortifications.
O foremost of men great treasure of virtues while she was practising austerities, the thousandeyed Indra  began to serve her.
The thousandeyed Indra served her by providing fire, Kusha grass, sticks for burning, water, fruits, roots and all other things desired by her.
Indra attended on Diti, stroking her limbs gently from time to time to help her regain their  suppleness and alleviate her fatigue.
O son of the Raghus ten years before completion of a thousand years. Diti, highly pleased with the services rendered by Indra, addressed him", saying:
"O best of the gods your illustrious father granted me a boon for a son I sought on completion of a thousand years (of penance).
O the best of the brave ten years is yet to go (for completion of austerities). You will  have a brother. May you prosper
O Child I'll create in him eagerness victory. Together with him you will gain victory over the three worlds. Relieved of sorrows, enjoy you'll with him".
After speaking thus to Indra, goddess Diti overpowered with sleep around midsday dropped off, her feet towards her head.
Indra laughed. He rejoiced at the sight of her ominous posture of sleeping with her feet towards her head and her hair falling on her feet.
O Rama with great courage Indra entered her womb and severed her embryo into  seven pieces.
O Rama that embryo, being severed by Vajra having a hundred edges, cried at high pitch which awakened Diti".
Highly powerful Indra, even while saying to the crying embryo  "Do not weep, Do not weep" severed it.
"Do not kill", "Do not kill", said Diti. Subsequently Indra, in deference to the words of his mother, emerged out of the womb.
Armed with Vajra, Indra addressed Diti with folded palms, saying, "O Devi you have slept,  with your head towards your feet and your hair falling on your feet".
"I have seized the opportunity and severed into seven pieces the foetus who would have been a slayer of Indra. O Devi shoudn't you forgive me"?इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्चत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fortysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Deeply distressed Diti, having come to know that the embryo had been severed into seven pieces, humbly spoke to the unassailable Indra.
"O Indra, Slayer of Balasura, because of my fault this embryo has been made into seven pieces and rendered useless. In this matter you have not committed any fault.
This disaster to the embryo has happened contrary to expectations. Hence, I seek a favour from you. Let these seven pieces become seven guardians of marut regions (regions of the wind).
O Son, all these seven are my sons of celestial beauty.They will become pesiding deities for Vata Skandha (divisions of wind) and let them be wellknown as maruts wandering in the universe.
Among them, one will move about in Brahmaloka, another in Indraloka, and the third, well known as vayu will move around in the sky.
O best of devatas by your command the other four sons will remain celestial, and will range about in four directions.
The thousandeyed Indra, slayer of Bala, on hearing Diti's words, addressed her with folded palms, saying:
"Everything will, no doubt, happen the way you said. Your sons will wander about as celestial beings. Prosperity to you."
"O Rama mother and sons having arrived at this conclusion in the tapovana  ascended to heaven with their desire fulfilled. This is what we have heard."
"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this is that country which was formerly inhabited by Indra. Here Indra  attended on Diti who achieved the fruit of her austerities.
"O Tiger among men (Rama) this highly virtuous and wellknown son named Vishala was born to Ikshvakus in Alambusa. Where, a city named Vishala was built.
O Rama mighty Hemachandra was Vishala's son. Hemachandra's successor was the celebrated Suchandra.
O Rama son of Suchandra was Dhumraswa, wellknown Sanjaya was the son of Dhumraswa.
Prosperous and powerful Sahadeva was Sanjaya's son. Highly virtuous Kusaswa was Sahadeva's son.
Brilliant and powerful Somadatta was Kusaswa's son. That Somadatta's son was Kakutstha is wellknown.
Son of Ikshvakus, Sumati comparable to devatas, invincible and exceedingly energetic is still ruling this city.
By the grace of the Ikshvakus, all the kings of Vishala have been long lived and exalted, valiant and deeply religious.
O Rama we shall spend the right happily here. O Best among men On the tomorrow we see Janaka".
Having heard of the arrival of Viswamitra the celebrated Sumati, most brilliant chief of kings proceeded (to receive him).
Along with his spiritual preceptors and relatives he paid Viswamitra great respect, enquired his wellbeing and said:
"O Sage no one is more blessed than me since you have favoured me with your arrival in my country."इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तचत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fortyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Getting together they enquired one another's health. And then Sumati spoke to the great ascetic (Viswamitra).
"O Sage, wish you well Who are these two youths who seem to possess the  prowess of celestial beings. They walk with the gait of an elephant or a lion. They are courageous like tiger or a bull. Their large eyes are like lotuspetals. They are armed with scimitars, bows and quivers. They are young and handsome like Aswinikumaras dropped from heaven casually. Whose sons are they? How did they  come here on foot? With what purpose?
O Great ascetic they resemble each other in personality, expression and gestures. They adorn this land like Sun and moon in the sky holding excellent weapons. These heroes have trodden paths difficult to traverse. For what purpose have they come? I want to hear clearly".
On hearing his words, he (Viswamitra) related all about their stay at Siddhashrama and the slaying of rakshasas.
After hearing Viswamitra, the king (Sumati) got exceedingly delighted and extended hospitality in accordance with tradition to the highly valiant sons of Dasaratha, the distinguished guests worthy of honour.
The descendants of Raghu (Rama and Lakshmana) having received great honour from Sumati, stayed there one night and thereafter set out for Mithila.
All the ascetics, having seen that auspicious city of Janaka worshipfully admired Mithila saying, 'Excellent, Excellent'
At the sight of an old uninhabited, beautiful and desolate hermitage in a grove near Mithila, the descendant of the Raghus enquired of the foremost among the ascetics (Viswamitra):
"O Venerable one I wish to know why this auspicios looking hermitage was deserted by ascetics? To whom did this belong in the past."
Eloquent and brilliant Viswamitra, replied to the descendant of the Raghus saying:
"O Descendant of the Raghus I shall tell all you about this hermitage cursed by the wrath of a great man.
O Best among men this hermitage resembling a celestial retreat and wellhonoured even by devatas  once belonged to illustrious Gautama.
O Highly renowned prince it was here in ancient times that Gautama in the company of Ahalya practised austerities for several years.
The thousandeyed Indra, consort of Sachi, having found an opportunity (during the absence of the ascetic), assumed the guise of the ascetic (Gautama) and said to Ahalya:
'O most beautiful one those overtaken by passion would not await the completion of the menstrual period (favourable for copulation). O woman of fine waist I desire union with you.'
O Delight of the Raghus the evilintentioned Ahalya, inclined towards the king of the celestials and  knowing him to be the thousandeyed Indra in the guise of the ascetic, consented for the union.
O Foremost of men with her heart's desire fulfilled, Ahalya said: "O Chief of the celestials I'm satisfied. O Lord, quit this place: O Lord of cthe gods, protect yourself and also me from Gautama in all respects."
Indra smilingly said to Ahalya, 'O One with lovely hips, I am  gratified. I shall go away the way I have come'.
O Rama he (Indra) came out of the leafhut quickly after his union with her, apprehensive of Gautama.
Subsequently, Indra beheld the great ascetic Gautama, unassailable by devatas and danavas, endowed with the power of ascetism, drenched with sacrifical waters,  shining like flaming fire, carrying sacrificial firewood and Kusha grass and preeminent  among sages, entering that leaf hut.
On seeing him, the face of the Lord of the gods (Indra) turned pale with fear. Having seen the wicked Indra with a thousandeyed in the guise of an ascetic the gentle sage Gautama got enraged and said:
"O Wicked natured one assuming my form you have done a forbidden act. For that reason you shall be devoid of  scrotum.
Cursed thus out of anger by eminent Gautama the  testicles of Indra immediately dropped down on the earth.
Having thus cursed Indra, he also cursed Ahalya: 'You will be staying here for thousands of years without food and subsisting on air, lying down in ashes, doing penance, without being seen by any living beings in this ashrama'.
'When the son of Dasaratha, the unassailable Rama enters this dreadful forest, you will be cleansed (of this sin)'.
'O Wickednatured one by offering hospitality to Rama, without covetousness and passion, you will happily live with me by regaining your present form'.
"Highly powerful Gautama who had performed rigid austerities thus cursed the wicked Ahalya and left this hermitage, for the peaks of Himavat mountain served by siddhas and charanas. Here he performed austerities"(said Viswamitra).इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे अष्टचत्वारिंशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fortyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Deprived of testicles, Indra with a frightened face addressed hordes of rishis and charanas with agni in the forefront.
'I have accomplished the objective of the devatas by creating obstacles to Gautama's  austerities, evoking in consequence the wrath of the magnanimous sage'.
'By his (Gautama's) wrath I have been deprived of my testicles. She (Ahalya) has  been deserted by him. He has lost his ascetic energy through the pronouncement of this great curse'.
'For that reason, O rishis, charanas and great devatas it is your duty to restore my testicles for the benefit I have given you'.
'Hearing Indra, all the devatas accompanied by maruts. Lead by the Firegod devatas approached and said':
'This ram (which has received the share of your sacrificial offerings) has testicles. As Indra has been deprived of his own take these testicles immediately and graft them on to Indra'.
Hearing the words of the Firegod the pitrudevatas assembled, uprooted the testicles of the ram and grafted them on to Indra.
"O Son of the Kakutsthas from then on the pitrudevatas have been accepting rams  without testicles as offerings in a sacrifice, with ram's testicles fitted on to Indra.
O Son of the Raghus illustrious Gautama's power of ascetism was such that thenceforth Indra possessed the testicles of a ram.
"Most brilliant Rama therefore enter the hermitage of the pious (Gautama) and liberate  this fortunate Ahalya of divine appearance (from the curse)."
In response to the words of Viswamitra Rama and Lakshmana entered the  hermitage, Viswamitra in front.
Rama beheld the highly fortunate Ahalya, shining brilliantly with the power of her asceticism. She could not be seen even by men, suras or asuras joined together. She looked  divine and illusory as if created with special efforts by Brahma. Though not clearly visible, she was shining bright like the light of the full Moon muffled by mists in the sky and like the inviolable light of the Sun reflected in the water.
By the words of Gautama, she became invisible to the three worlds till the appearance of Rama.
With the expiry of the period of the curse, the Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) speared and she became perceptible when Rama touched her feet.
Recalling the words of Gautama, she received them with water to wash their feet and offerings made with due devotion Rama accepted her hospitality extended in accordance tradition.
Amidst sounds of celestial kettledrums, devatas showered flowers, gandharvas sang and apsarasa danced. There was a great assemblage (of divinities).
On seeing Ahalya, her body purified by the power of penance at Gautama's command, the devatas worshipfully exclaimed, 'Excellent, Excellent'
Brilliant Gautam, the great ascetic, along with Ahalya, worshipped Rama  according to tradition, with delight and continued with his austerities.
Having received due hospitality from the great ascetic Gautama Rama also set out towards Mithila.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनपञ्चाशस्सर्गः।।Thus ends the fortyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Rama accompanied by Lakshmana with Viswamitra ahead proceeded in northeasterly direction and reached the sacrificial ground.
Rama with Lakshmana told the tiger among ascetics Viswamitra that the preparations or the sacrifice by the illustrious king Janaka were excellent.
O Illustrious sage thousands of brahmins living in different countries and versed in  the study of the vedas have assembled here. The shelters for ascetics are thronged with hundreds of carts. O Great ascetic let us choose a place where we can stay.
Great ascetic Viswamitra, hearing Rama's words, chose a nottoocrowded place near a watersource for encampment.
When the king heard of the arrival of Viswamitra he went forward with Satananda, the blemishless family priest walking ahead in order to welcome him with humility.
Eminent officiating priests speedily brought the offerings of worship and paid obeisance to Viswamitra with prayers.
Viswamitra received illustrious king Janaka's worship and enquired about the welfare of the king and the conduct of the sacrifice.
Viswamitra duly enquired the wellbeing of the sages and the spiritual teachers, priests in right order. And thereafter the rest joined them in great delight.
The king then folded his hands in supplication to the foremost of ascetics, Viswamitra, saying "O Venerable one please be seated along with the eminent ascetics."
In response to Janaka's words, great sage Viswamitra occupied his seat. Thereafter the family priests, officiationg priests of the sacrifice, counsellors and also the king occupied their seats according to their rank.
Thereafter the king looked on all sides and  saw all of them seated  according to their rank and addressed Viswamitra saying:
"Today my sacrifice has been rendered fruitful by the devatas. I have reaped the fruit of my sacrifice today by your venerable presence.
O Preeminent among ascetics O brahmana you have come to my sacrificial mandap along with these ascetics Blessed am I Obliged am I.
O Brahmarshi learned men say, only twelve days remain for completion of this acrifice. Thereafter O Viswamitra you should see devatas claiming their shares".
Having said this, the king (Janaka) with a cheerful countenance and saluting with folded palms again asked that tiger among ascetics (Viswamitra):
"O Sage (Viswamitra), be blessed. Who are these two young men with the prowess of the celestials the gait of an elephant or a lion? They resemble a tiger or a bull in courage. They have large eyes like lotuspetals. They are armed with scimitars bows and quivers. With their approaching youth, they resemble the Aswinikumaras in beauty. They look like gods who have descended on earth from heaven out of their free will. Whose sons are they? How did they come here on foot? And for what purpose?
Great ascetic, these two young men with hair falling on their temples like the wings of a crow, each of them resemble the other in personality, expressions and gestures. Wielding excellent weapons they adorn this land like the Moon and the Sun deck the sky. Whose sons are they? I wish truly to hear about these heroes".
Hearing the words of the magnanimous Janaka, Viswamitra presented them to him saying that they were the illustrious sons of Dasaratha.
The great ascetic Viswamitra, who was highly powerful related to the distinguished Janaka in full their undaunted journey to Siddhashrama and the slaughter of rakshasas there, the view of the city of Vishala, meeting with Ahalya and Gautama and the inquisitiveness about the great bow which brought them to Mithila and then kept quiet.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाणडे पञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the fiftieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Satananda the eldest son of Gautama, a great sage who looked brilliant with the power of austerities was thrilled to hear the words of Viswamitra the intellectual and experienced great astonishment on beholding Rama.
Satananda saw the two princes comfortably seated nearby and said to Viswamitra, the foremost of the ascetics:
"O Tiger among ascetics, was my renowned mother who had been practising intense austerities for long shown to the prince (Rama)?
Did my highly lustrous and celebrated mother offer homage to Rama, worthy of reverence by all living beings, with things available in the forest?
O highly powerful sage, was Rama told the old story about the misdeed of god (Indra) to my mother?
O Son of Kushika (Viswamitra) be blessed. O the best among the ascetics, as a result of beholding Rama, was my mother united with my father?
O Son of Kushika was Rama honoured by my father? Was my most brilliant father  honoured by illustrious Rama when he arrived?
O Kushika's son did pious Rama welcome my father with a tranquil mind when he arrived?"
Great sage Viswamitra equipped with the knowledge of words heard Satananda who was proficient in speech. And replied:
O Best of ascetics (Satananda) All that is required to be done has been done and nothing was omitted. Ahalya was united with sage Gautama like Renuka with Jamadagni.
Having heard Viswamitra the highly brilliant Satananda said to Rama:
"O Best of men O Son of the Raghus you are fortunate to have come here following the invincible maharshi Viswamitra. Welcome to you.
Highly lustrous Viswamitra has performed deeds which defy all imagination. By his austerities, he became Brahmarshi and possesses unparalleled radiance. Know him to be the supreme resort.
Rama Son of Kushika (Viswamitra) who has performed great austerities is your protector. Therefore, there is none on this earth more fortunate than you.
I shall tell you about the power and achievement of the magnanimous son of Kushika Viswamitra. Listen
This righteousminded sage, subduer of enemies, knower of dharma knowledgeable in all branches of learning, devoted to the welfare of his subjects ruled as a king for long.
There was a king named Kusa who was the son of Brahma. His son was Kusanabha who was supremely righteous and strong.
Wellknown Gadhi was the son of Kusanabha. Highly lustrous and mighty ascetic Viswamitra is the son of Gadhi.
Highly lustrous Viswamitra ruled the earth. As a king he ruled over his kingdom for  thousands of years.
Once that highly lustrous Viswamitra having assembled his army of the magnitude of akshauhini went round the earth.
Rama while Viswamitra was wandering about kingdoms, cities, rivers, mountains and  hermitages, he gradually reached the ashram of Vasishta. That hermitage afounded in a variety of trees, species of animals, siddhas, charanas, devatas, danavas, gandharvas and kinnaras, multitudes of birds and resting deer. It was inhabited by brahmarshis and devarishis, by sages who had attained perfection through austerities, by those resembling fire in brightness, by the magnanimous and the selfrestrained, by those who had conquered anger and controlled their senses, who was devoted to prayers and offerings of libations. Some of them subsisted on water, some on air. Some lived on fallen leaves, some on fruits and roots. The hermitage looked bedecked with valakhilyas (born from Vala of Brahma ) and vaikhanasas (born from the nails of Brahma).
Highly powerful Viswamitra, foremost among the conquerors, (thus) saw the hermitage of Vasishta which looked like another Brahmaloka.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।Thus ends the fiftyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Overwhelmed with joy the mighty, heroic Viswamitra upon seeing Vasishta, the greatest among ascetics, was and offered respectful salutations.
Adorable Vasishta received Viswamitra with words of welcome and ordered a seat for him.
With the sagacious Viswamitra seated the great ascetic, duly offered him fruits and roots.
Foremost among kings, the brilliant Viswamitra, having received  hospitality from Vasishta, enquired about his welbeing his austerities, his firesacrifices, his disciples and trees (in his hermitage). Vasishta, too, informed him of the welfare of all.
Vasishta, son of Brahma, the greatest among those who recite prayers and possess rich asceticism enquired of king Viswamitra comfortably seated (before him):
"O King, is it all well with you? O righteous one O  heroic one are you ruling (your subjects) in accordance with the duties enjoined upon the king? Do you rule them in conformity with the code of moralit in order to make them happy.
Are your servants provided well with their requirements? Do they abide by your command? O Destroyer of foes have all your enemies been conquered ?
O Tormentor of enemies O Sinless one O Tiger among men is it all well with your army, treasury, friends, sons and grandsons?
Highly brilliant king Viswamitra, humbly informed Vasishta that all was well.
Both the righteous personalities dwelt at length on various matters and interesting anecdotes with great delight and derived mutual pleasure.
O Descendent of Raghu at the end of the conversation, venerable Vasishta, smiling as it were said to Viswamitra
O Highy powerful Viswamitra I wish to offer appropriate hospitality to you and to your incomparable army. Be pleased to accept it.
Please accept the honour I extend. Being a king, you are a distinguished guest. you deserve to be treated respectfully in all possible ways".
To these words of Vasishta, the great intellectual Viswamitra said, "you have spoken pleasing words. This in itself is hospitality for me".
"O Worshipful one O Profoundly wise one you are worthy of homage. You have excellently honoured me in all possible ways with whatever fruits and roots available in your hermitage, with water for washing feet and for sipping. You have permitted me darshan with your revered self. I shall leave (now). My regards Look upon me with eyes of friendship".
As the king was addressing thus the righteous and generous Vasishta, repeatedly requested him to accept his hospitality.
The son of Gadhi said to Vasishta, "O Preeminent among sages, be it so, O venerable one they will be done".
Vasishta who was highly brilliant the greatest among those who meditate (on Brahman) and free from sins was pleased. Thereafter he called the speckled cow (Kamadhenu):
"O Sabala, come on quick Listen to my words. I have decided to honour this royal saint and his army with excellent food. Make necessary arrangemets.
O Kamadhenu quickly entertain them for my sake with the food of six kinds of tastes (varieties of rich dishes) as desired by each.
O Sabala create at once all food items consisting of liquids and solids for drinking, tasting and siping."इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्विपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।Thus ends the fiftysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Destroyer of foes (Rama)" addressed thus by Vasishta the wishfulfilling Sabala satisfied each one's  desires.
Sugarcane, honey and fried grain, invigorating liquors in good containers, excellent drinks and varieties of food (were served).
Heaps of hot rice as high as mountains, savoury food, condiments and on abundance of curd, various kinds of soups, containers in their thousands completely filled with edibles with all six tastes and preparations made of jaggery (were distributed).
"O Rama, Vasistha entertained everybody in Viswamitra's army to their full satisfaction. They were all wellfed and happy.
King Viswamitra along with ladies, priests and brahmins including the royal sage were fully satisfied and delighted.
Having received the hospitality along with his counsellors, ministers and attendants, Viswamitra, filled with great delight, said to Vasishta":
"O Brahman you are worthy of worship. I was received with reverence and wellentertained by you. O Sage conversant with speech listen.
"I shall give you a hundred thousand cows in exchange for Sabala. O Respectable one this cow is a gem. A king (along) has a right on jewels, O Brahmin, for that reason, Sabala rightfully belongs to me. Therefore, give this cow".
Addressed the by Viswamitra venerable and righteous Vasishta who was of the earth  ascetic replied:
"O King I shall not exchange Sabala for a hundred thousand for even or a hundred crore cows or heaps of silver.
O Suppressor of enemies Viswamitra it is not proper to separate this cow from me. The relationship between Sabala and me is permanent like the relationship between a  righteous man and his fame.
For havyam (oblations to gods) and kavyam (oblations to ancestors), for fulfilling the necessities of life, maintenance of the sacred fire and offering oblations to all spirits of created beings, and for offerings made to the Firegod I depend on this cow.
O Royal saint swaha and vashat and various branches of learning are all dependent on this cow. No doubt about it.
This one is truly my whole possession, it always gives me contentment. O King for various reasons, I will not give Sabala to you".
To there words of Vasishta, Viswamitra who is skilful in conversation reacted with extreme excitement:
"I shall give fourteen thousand elephants with gold trappings around the neck and girth,  and with goads made of gold.
I shall give you eight hundred chariots made of gold and decorated with small tinkling bells, each chariot yoked with four white horses.
O Maharshi of auspicious vows I shall give you eleven thousand mighty horses of good breed born in good countries.
I shall give one crore young cows of various colours. Give me Sabala.
O Best of brahmins I shall offer you jewels or gold as much as you desire. I shall give you everything. Give this Sabala to me".
To these words of sagacious Viswamitra the adorable Vasishta replied: "O King I shall not give Sabala."
"This is verily my jewel, my wealth my very life. This is allinall for me.
O King verily this Sabala is useful for my darsa and purnamasa sacrifices, for appropriate gifts and various rites.
O King this (cow) is undoubtedly the source of all my actions. Why these useless words? I will never give this wishfulfilling cow".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रिपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rama when sage Vasishta did not consent to part with the wishfulfilling cow, Viswamitra dragged Sabala by force.
O Rama when she was being taken away by the powerful king the distressed Sabala thus reflected choked with sorrow":
"I am being carried away by attendants of the king in this greatly distressed and pitiable condition. Have I been abandoned by the magnanimous Vasishta?
What harm have I done to the pious maharshi, a compassionate soul? Why does he  forsake me, his auspicious one, despite my innocence and devotion"?
"O Destroyer of enemies thus thinking and repeatedly sighing, that cow shook off those attendants who were in hundreds and ran towards the feet of the illustrious Vasishta with the speed of the wind.
Lowing and moaning, standing before Vasishta, roaring like thunder and of kettledrum, Sabala said:
"O Brahma's son O Venerable one you have abandoned me? For what reason the servants of the king are taking me away from you"?
Addressed thus, Bramharshi said to Sabala, like to  a sister whose heart is afflicted with sorrow:
"O Sabala I am not forsaking you. You have done me no harm. This highly powerful king is forcibly carrying you away from me.
I am no match for his strength, especially he is a king. Being king, he is a warrior, powerful and lord of the earth.
He has an entire akshauhini composed of horses, chariots, elephants and banners. Hence he is stonger".
To these words of  brahmarshi Vasishta armed with immeasurable power, Sabala, who knew the use of words, replied with humility:
"O Best of brahmins it is held that the strength of a kshatriya is no greater than a brahmin's. A brahmin possesses great strength his strength is divine. It is greater than that of a kshatriya.
Your power is immeasurable. Even though highly valiant, Viswamitra is not greater than you in strength. Your power is unequalled.
O Highly fortunate one I am possessed of your brahminic power. Command me. I will destroy the insolent and power of that wickedminded one.
O Rama to this, glorious Vasishta replied: "Create an army capable of crushing the enemy power.
Hearing his words Kamadhenu created an army. O Rama her lowing brought into being Paplavas in hundreds who destroyed the entire army of Viswamitra, while he looked on helplessly.
Thereafter the king (Viswamitra), having seen his army thus routed, flew into a fury. Wideeyed with anger, he sat in his chariot and destoyed the Paplavas with various kinds of weapons.
Having seen hundreds of Paplavas crushed by Viswamitra, once again she created out of anger. Sakas mixed with Yavanas.
Sakas mixed with Yavanas, resembling golden filaments possessing brilliance and supreme bravery, covered the earth.
Sakas and Yavanas, armed with swords and lances, clad in yellow apparel, looking  like flaming fire destroyed the entire army.
Thereafter, most brilliant Viswamitra released weapons. With these weapons, the Yavanas, Kambhojas and Paplavas were scattered".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुष्पञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thereafter, Vasishta having seen the forces tortured and overpowered by the weapons of Viswamitra said, "O Kamadhenu create additional forces through your yogic power."
"From her lowing Kambhojas bright like the Sun, from the udder Paplavas, weapons in  hand, from the vagina Yavanas, from the anus Sakas, from the roots of the hair Mlecchas along with Kiratas and Haritas were born.
O descendant of the Raghus, Viswamitra's army consisting of infantry, elephants, horses, chariots has been entirely destroyed by them instantly.
Having seen the army destroyed by the powerful Vasishta, one hundred sons of Viswamitra became extremely furious and armed with various kinds of weapons rushed towards Vasishta, the best among ascetics. Adorable sage Vasishta, reduced them to ashes with just a 'humkara' (the loud 'hum' sound produced with the mouth)
Then one hundred sons of Viswamitra together with their horses, chariots and foot soldiers were reduced to ashes in a moment by the powerful Vasishta.
Seeing his sons and army destroyed the illustrious Viswamitra was filled with shame and anxiety.
Like the ocean without waves or the snake bereft of fangs or the Sun eclipsed by Rahu, suddenly (Viswamitra) looked cheerless and dull.
Having lost his sons and the army, like a bird with wings clipped, wretched, with pride vanished and confidence shattered Viswamitra fell into despondency.
Viswamitra, having entrusted one of his remaining sons to rule the kingdom in accordance with the kshatriya tradition reached the forest.
Mighty ascetic Viswamitra, reached the slopes of the Himavat mountain inhabited by kinnaras and uragas (serpents) and performed  austerities in order to propitiate lord Mahadeva.
After some time, lord of the gods, bestower of boons, Maheswara with the symbol of the bull on the banner  appeared before mighty Viswamitra.
O King what are you performing the penance for? Tell me what you want? I am bestower of boons. Speak out you desire (said Lord Siva).
Having heard this from the god, Viswamitra who performed the great austerities prostrated before Mahadeva and said these words.
O Irreproachable one O Mahadeva if you are pleased with me, make me an expert in Dhanurveda, the science of archery with all it secrets, angas (branches), upangas (subdivisions) and Upanishads.
O Irreproachable one whatever weapons are known to devatas, danavas, maharshis, gandharvas, yakshas, rakshasas, be revealed to me.
O Lord of the gods by your favour let my desire be fulfilled. Lord Mahadeva having said: 'Be it so' vanished.
Rajarshi Viswamitra endowed with supreme power became very haughty. Having obtained the weapons, his insolence was greatly accentuated.
Like the sea during the full moon, with his increased power (blessed with the invincible strength of the weapons) Viswamitra thought the foremost of ascetics Vasishta was (already) slain. (It shows the height of the king's ignorance and arrogance).
Thereafter king Viswamitra having proceeded towards the hermitage (of Vasishta) and released the weapons by the energy of which the entire forest of the ascetics was burnt down.
On seeing the weapons discharged by the intelligent Viswamitra saints in hundreds fled in all directions.
The disciples of Vasishta as well as animals and birds got terrified by the fear and fled in their thousands in all directions.
The greatsoul Vasishta's hermitage became deserted and silent in an instant like a barren field.
Even while Vasistha was repeatedly  assuring  the saints saying "Do not fear, I will now destroy Viswamitra, son of Gadhi just as the Sun dispels the morning mist (they fled)".
The infuriated Vasishta who was highly brilliant, foremost among those who meditate said to Viswamitra:
"O Fool this hermitage has been developed over a long time. Why did you destroy it?  On account of your wickedness you will not live long."
Exceedingly furious Vasishta quickly lifted up his staff which looked like the staff of Yama (the od of death), like smokeless fire at the time of destruction of the worlds.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thus said Vasishta. Mighty Viswamitra lifted up agneya astra (shaft of fire) and discharging it said, 'stay, stay'.
Venerable Vasishta, in fury lifted the Brahmadanda which was like another rod of death. And spoke these words:
"O wicked kshatriya O son of Gadhi here I stand. Show me your strength and the pride of your arms. I will destroy them now.
O mean kshatriya where does your energy of a kshatriya stand in comparison with the great energy of Brahma? Behold my Brahmabala (Brahman's energy)".
The Brahmadanda (released by Vasishta) put down the dreadful agneya astra released by Gadhi's son just like the force of fire is extinguished by water.
The incensed son of Gadhi employed varuna, raudra, aindra, pasupata and aishika  weapons.
"O Descendent of Raghu Viswamitra employed weapons like manava, mohana, gandharva, swapana, jrimbhana, madana, santapana, vilapana, shoshana, darana, vajra weapons, Brahma, kala and varuna pasas, the favourite painaka, daita, shushka, ardra vajras, danda, paisacha, krauncha, weapons, dharmachakra, kalachakra, vishnuchakras, vayavya, mathana, hayasira weapons, kanakala, musala powers, vaidyadhara, kalatrishula, kapala, kankana weapons discharged against Vasishta the best of ascetics. All this became aweful.
"O Descendent of Raghu Viswamitra employed weapons like manava, mohana, gandharva, swapana, jrimbhana, madana, santapana, vilapana, shoshana, darana, vajra weapons, Brahma, kala and varuna pasas, the favourite painaka, daita, shushka, ardra vajras, danda, paisacha, krauncha, weapons, dharmachakra, kalachakra, vishnuchakras, vayavya, mathana, hayasira weapons, kanakala, musala powers, vaidyadhara, kalatrishula, kapala, kankana weapons discharged against Vasishta the best of ascetics. All this became aweful.
Vasishta son of Brahma, swallowed all those weapons with his staff. When those weapons were humbled, son of Gadhi employed Brahmastra.
All the devatas, with Agni in the forefront, divine rishis, great uragas and gandharvas were agitated seeing the Brahmastra raised. When Brahmastra was discharged, the  three worlds became distressed.
O Descendant of Raghu Vasishta who possessed the energy of Brahma swallowed that very dreadful Brahmastra entirely with the help of Brahmadanda.
While swallowing Brahmastra  the great Vasishta looked fierce and  terrible causing the three worlds to faint.
From every pore of the great Vasishta's body flames resembling rays of light with smoke emerged.
The staff of Brahma in Vasishta's hand, resembling smokeless fire at the end of the dissolution of the worlds inflamed like another rod of death.
Then hosts of saints praised Vasishta, the best among sages, saying "O Brahmin, your energy is infallible, hold your energy by your enegy".
'O Brahman great ascetic Viswamitra was controlled by you. O Best of ascetics be pleased and let the worlds be delivered from distress'.
At this, Vasishta the most brilliant ascetic became quiet. The humiliated Viswamitra heaved a sigh and spoke these words:
Shame Where is the might of a kshatriya? The energy of a brahmin is the real  energy. The staff of Brahma has singly destroyed all my weapons".
"Now I have realised the reason. With clear mind and senses, I shall undertake intense penance which will earn me brahminhood".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्पञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Descendant of Raghu (Rama) having created enmity between himself and the magnanimous Vasishta, Viswamitra recollecting the disgrace and repeatedly sighing with a distressed heart  went with his eldest wife towards southern quarter to perform  rigorous penance. Subsisting on fruits and roots and his senses underfull control he performed the most rigid austerities.
After some time, four sons, Havishyanda, Madhushyanda, Drudhanetra and Maharatha, who (later) wer wedded to truth and duty, were born."
A thousand years passed. The Grandsire of the worlds, Brahma, appeared. He spoke to Viswamitra, the great ascetic, these pleasant words:
"O Son of Kushika with your austerities you have won the worlds of the rajarshis. On account of your austerities, you are acknowledged a rajarshi".
Having said this the glorious (Brahma), supreme lord of the worlds, left for his abode in Brahmaloka, in heaven accompanied by the gods.
On hearing this Viswamitra hanging down his face a little with shame and anger and grief said:
"I have performed intense austerities. Yet rishis and devatas have recognised me only as a rajarshi. I think my penance has yielded fruit.
"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) this celebrated intellectual having decided in his mind once again performed greater austerities.
At this time there lived a celebrated king, renowned in the Ikshvakus race, named Trisanku, who was truthful and self restrained.
"O Son of the Raghus (Rama) a thought arose in his mind to enter heaven with his physical body by performing a sacrifice.
Summoning Vasishta he (Trisahnku) communicated his intention, but the great Vasishta said it was not possible.
Refused by Vasishta, the king went south in order to fulfil his purpose and approached Vasishta's sons.
Most brilliant Trisanku approached the sons of Vasishta in the place where they  had been performing austerities for a long time. There he saw the famous, exceedingly effulgent sons of Vasishta one hundred in number practising penance.
The king, having approached all the illustrious sons of his spiritual guide, paid obeisance to them in order of seniority. Bowing down his face in humility and with folded palms, he addressed all those distinguished sons of Vasishta saying:
O protectors of those who seek refuge in you, protect me. Wish you well. I have been refused by the great Vasishta.
'I wish to perform a great sacrifice. You are worthy enough to tender your consent. I pay homage to all the sons of my spiritual guide oblige.
You, brahmins are established in austerity. I bow to you. I beg all of you to direct me with composed minds to direct me in order to attain heaven in physical form'.
O Ascetocs after having been rejected by Vasishta. I do not see any way other than the sons of my spiritual guide to help me achieve my purpose.
For all the descendants of Ikshvakus the spiritual preceptor is the supreme resort for  salvation. Learned spiritual preceptors have always liberated kings. Hence you are all gods to me only next to Vasishta".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rama to these words of king Trisanku, the hundred sons of the sage angrily reacted:
'O Evilminded one having been refused by the Guru true to his word, how could you bypass him and approach us who are mere off shoots (of the main).
For all the kings of the Ikshvakus race, their chief priest is their Guru. It is not possible to bypass the spiritual preceptor who is true to his word preceptor.
When an adorable sage like Vasishta has already said, it is not possible, how can we help you conduct such a sacrifice?
O Best one among men you are childish. Return to your capital. O Monarch the most venerable Vasishta is capable of conducting sacrifices performed by anybody in the three worlds. How can we dishonour him'?
Having heard the confused words uttered by the sages in a state of anger, the king said again:
"O Men endowed with the wealth of asceticism I was rejected by my guru and now by his sons. I shall seek another way. Farewell to you".
Having seen his fierce intent, the saint's sons were infuriated. They cursed him saying, "Be a Chandala"
With this the highsouled sons of Vasishta entered their hermitage. And one night after the king became a Chandala (a lowcaste man).
The king was tranformed into a darkcomplexioned dirty man with dishevelled hair. His body was besmeared with ashes and on his robes lay wreath collected from the cemetery. He had on him dark (soiled) clothes, and ornaments made of iron.
"O Rama seeing him in the form of a chandala, all his counsellors, inhabitants of the city including his followers fled away.
O Descendant of Kakustha wandering alone burning with distress night and day the king went to Viswamitra who was rich in asceticism.
O Rama on seeing the king reduced to a useless a chandala, sage Viswamitra was touched with pity".
Exceedingly energetic and deeply pious, he looked at the king who was frightful in appearance and addressed him with compassion saying, "welfare to you".
"O Mighty prince what brings your here, for you are the heroic lord of Ayodhya? Whose curse turned you into a chandala"?
In response to his words the king,  who had fallen into the state of a chandala yet proficient in expression, spoke to one (Viswamitra) expert in speech, with folded hands.
"Rejected by my guru and his sons, what I achieved was disaster and what I could not was the fulfilment of my wish.
O Gentle sage it is my intention to enter heaven with my physical body. I performed a hundred sacrifices but  did not reap its fruit.
O Gentle sage I have never told a lie in spite of troubled circumstances, I shall never dabble in falsehood. I swear upon it by kshatriya morality .
I have performed various sacirifices and ruled over my people guided by the law of righteousness. I have pleased eminent elders with my conduct and character.
O Preeminent among sages I endeavour to do my duty. I intend to perform a sacrifice. My gurus do not appreciate this.
I consider destiny to be allpowerful. The effort of a man goes in vain. Everything is controlled by destiny. It is the supreme resort.
My merits have been destroyed by destiny. Deeply afflicted, I crave a favour from you. You are fit to grant it. Wish you well
I will not take refuge in anybody. There is no other protector for me. You are capable of averting my reverses in fate with human effort".   इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे अष्टपञ्चाशस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftyeighth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
What the king said was proved by his chandala form which the son of Kushika (Viswamitra) heard and out of compassion spoke these sweet words:
"O Descendant of Ikshvakus, O child, welcome. I know you as highly righteous. O eminent among kings fear not. I offer you refuge.
O king I shall invite pious maharshis to assist you in the sacrifice which you will be able to perform with great relief.
With the present physical body disfigured by the curse of your spiritual preceptor, you shall go to heaven.
O King since you have taken refuge in Viswamitra who is the protector of those who resort to him, I think heaven is already within your reach".
Most brilliant Viswamitra having thus spoken, ordered his deeply religious and highly learned sons to make preparations for the sacrifice.
He summoned all his disciples, and said, "Children bring here hosts of rishis along with their disciples and friends, officiating priests and persons wellversed in the Srutis. This is my order.
If any one should speak with disrespect in response to my order, you may report the matter to me in full".
At his command the disciples set out in different directions. And as a result, expounders of the vedas began arriving from various countries.
All the disciples on their return, communicated to the sage shining in splendour what the expounders of the vedas had said.
Having heard your words, all brahmins except Mahodaya have arrived from all countries.
O Preeminent among ascetics Here is what the hundred sons of Vasishta spoke in anger.
When a kshatriya acts as a priest for the sacrifice, particularly for a chandala, how can gods and sages partake the offerings?
Joining Viswamitra, (in chanting the mantras during the yaga) how will the great brahmins attain heaven after partaking the food offered by of Chandala?
O Best among ascetics all the sons of Vasishta along with Mahodaya with their eyes reddened in anger spoke these harsh words":
On hearing the words (of the hundred sons of Vasishta uttered in anger) Viswamitra, preeminent among ascetics, spoke furiously with eyes reddened in anger.
"I am blameless. I have practised rigorous penance. These wicked ones who have abused (a sage like me) will be reduced to ashes.
Caught by the noose of death this day, they shall be brought  to the abode of Yama  and for seven hundred births, feed on corpses.
Reborn as the merciless race of mushtikas, feeding on the flesh of dogs, hideous and deformed, they shall wander in these worlds.
The wicked Mahodaya, who blamed a sage like me so faultless shall be reborn in the race of the nishadas vulnerable to abuse by all.
As a consequence of my anger that Mahodaya, devoid of mercy and  taking pleasure in depriving others of their life, will pursue a wretched life for a long time".
The most powerful sage Viswamitra of fierce asceticism fell silent after after uttering this curse in the assembly of rishis.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the fiftyninth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The most brilliant Viswamitra, having destroyed the sons of Vasishta including Mahodaya by his ascetic power, said this in the midst of saints:
"This religious and generous king born in the Ikshvaku race, wellknown as Trisanku sought my refuge to gain heaven with his physical body,
Join me in the performance of this sacrifice in a manner by which he (Trisanku) attains  heaven with his physical body".
Agreeing to these words of Viswamitra all the rishis, knowers of spiritual order and endowed with righteousness assembled there said:
"Born in the line of Kusika, this sage is extremely cholerictempered. Whatever he says must be properly carried out. There should be no resitation on this score. The venerable sage is like fire. He will curse us if angered.
Hence let the sacrifice be performed in such a manner that the descendant of the Ikshvakus would attain heaven with his physical body through the spiritual power of Viswamitra. All of you commence the sacrifice".
The maharshis having resolved performed their respective activities relating to the sacrifice. The brilliant Viswamitra acted as the chief officiating priest.
The officiating priests proficient in chanting mantras performed in order of their respective ranks all the rites in accordance with the Yojanakalpa adhering to codes and traditions.
Long after, the mighty ascetic Viswamitra  invoked all the gods to partake their share of offerings.
When, the gods invited by him did not come to receive their share of offerings, the great ascetic Viswamitra seized with anger lifted the sacrificial ladle and said to Trisanku:
"O King behold the prowess of my selfearned asceticism. With my spiritual might, I shall send you to heaven with your physical body O King go to heaven with physical body which is not possible for anybody to accomplish.
By the power of what little fruit of austerities I have earned, I shall send to heaven with your body".
"O Descendant of Kakustha (Rama) when the sage had said these words, the king with his physical body ascended to heaven in the presence of the sages.
On ascending to heaven Trisanku saw Indra (destroyer of Paka) along with hosts of  gods. Indra said to him:
"O Trisanku you are not fit to inhabit heaven. Go back, you fool Doomed by the curse of your spiritual preceptor, fall on earth, head down.
Thus spoken to by Indra, Trisanku crying, "O Viswamitra, Protect me, Protect me" started falling down.
Having heard the wailing Trisanku, the enraged Viswamitra shouted, "Stay, Stay".
Standing in the midst of the ascetics, that  mighty sage who conjured up a constellation of seven new rishis (stars) looked like another creator Brahma. Overcome by anger the illustrious sage created a new group of stars in the southern direction.
Having created a constellation of stars, Viswamitra out of anger said, "I will create  another Indra or this world will be without Indra" and commenced to create even gods.
Struck with wonder and fear, hosts of rishis, suras and asuras humbly addressed Viswamitra.
"O Glorious maharshi, this king cursed by his spiritual preceptor is not worthy of going to heaven with his physical body".
The son of Kushika (Viswamitra), the preeminent ascetic heard the gods and said these praiseworthy words:
"I wish you well Having promised king Trisanku ascent to heaven with his  physical form, I do not wish to go back on my word.
Let this heaven be an eternal abode for Trisanku in his physical form All these stars created by me shall endure as long as the worlds survive. O gods it behoves of you to accord consent to this".
Thus addressed, all the gods, replied to the preeminent ascetic, "O Best among sages, be blessed let thy will be donel. Those many celebrated stars shall stay on all sides outside the path of Vaisvanara (zodiac) in the firmament. Amidst those stars, Trisanku, shining brilliantly like an immortal, shall stay on, head down".
These stars will follow this illustrious one (Trisanku), the best of kings who gained his object, as if he had attained heaven.
In this manner extolled by all devatas and rishis, mighty and righteous Viswamitra said, 'well let it be so'.
"O Best among men (Rama) then at the conclusion of the sacrifice the great gods and saints went the way they had come".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixtieth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
O Tiger among men (Rama) thereafter great Viswamitra seeing the departing sages of the forest said:
"O Highsouled sages, there is lake Pushkara in the vast western region. There in the forest fit for austerities we shall practise penance peacefully".
With this the most powerful sage Viswamitra reached Pushkara where living on fruits and roots, he carried out intense, unsurpassable,  austerities.
At this time Ambarisha, a wellknown king of Ayodhya, launched preparations for a  sacrifice.
While he was performing the sacrifice Indra stole away the sacrificial animal. The animal could not be traced. Hence the priest said to the king:
"O King the animal has been stolen away and because of your inability to enforce law, it could not be traced. O Lord of men the king who fails to protect (his dependents)  perishes by his own faults.
"O Best of men you must pay a big price for this. Bring either the beast or a man immediately so that the sacrifice can be completed".
"O Best of men (Rama) hearing the words of the high priest, the highly intellectual king searched for a human victim in exchange for thousands of cows.
O Dear Rama, the delight of Raghu clan the king scoured countries, villages, cities, forests, sacred hermitages till he saw sage Richika in the Bhrigutunda mountain sitting with his sons and wie.
The most brilliant king(Ambarisha) bowing to sage Richika, a brahmarshi who looked extremely resplendent with penance, propitiated him, enquired about the welfare of all and finally said":
"O Fortunate descendent of the Bhrigu race if your son is sold as a sacrificial animal in exchange for a hundred thousand cows, my purpose will be answered.
I have roamed all countries but could not final the sacrificial animal. Should'nt you spare one of your sons for a price"?
Thus addressed the exceedingly brilliant Richika said, "O Best among men in no way shall I sell my first born".
Having heard Richika, the miserable mother of great sons, addressed Ambarisha, the foremost of men, saying:
Venerable descendant of the Bhrugus (sage Richika) said that the eldest son cannot be sold. "O King the youngest son, Sunaka, is my beloved son. You know, O King for that reason I will not give my yougest son".
"O Best among men generally, the eldest sons are the favourites of their fathers, the youngest their mothers: For that reason, I shall keep my youngest son.
O Rama the sage and his wife having spoken thus, their middle son Sunassepha said on his own:
O King my father says his eldest son cannot be sold, mother says that her  youngest son cannot be spared. From this I think middle son is already sold away. Therefore, take me"
"O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) having purchased Sunassepha for a hundred thousands of cows the king refurned immensely pleased.
O Foremost of men, O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) the illustrious king (Ambarisha) took Sunassepha with him. (On the way) at Pushkara he took some rest at noon.
While the king was resting at Pushkara, the famous Sunassepha, very much distressed, happened to see his maternal uncle Viswamitra in the company of other sages performing austerities.
With his face discoloured due to thirst and fatigue, he (Sunassepha) immediately fell into the sage's lap in a pitiable condition and said:
"O Noble man O Preeminent among ascetics I have no mother nor father nor friends nor relatives. You should protect me according to dharma.
O Best among ascetics you are the protecor of everybody. You are promoter of others' welfare. May the king fulfil his purpose. May I live long and become immortal and attain heaven after performing great penance. May I enjoy heaven.
O Virtuous one with a kind heart protect this orphan. Like a father who protects his son, save me from this peril".
Having heard Sunassepha, mighty ascetic Viswamitra consoled him in many ways and said to his sons:
O sons of the sage this young boy has sought my protection. O Sons you may grant him his desire by merely offering your life.
Engaged in the observance of righteousness, all of you have done virtuous deeds. By becoming sacrificial animals for the king, you may satisfy Agni.
Then Sunassepha will be protected. The king's sacrifice will continue without hindrance. The gods will be gratified. My words also will come true".
"O Best of men (Rama) in response to the words of the sage Madhuchanda and others said thus in a casual way with selfesteem.
O Lord protecting other's son by abandoning one' own is like partaking the flesh of a dog. We consider it a prohibited act".
On hearing the words of his sons Viswamitra, the eminent ascetic, eyes reddened with anger began to speak:
"(You have) not only trangressed my words but also (you are) censurable according to dharma. You have uttered such audacious and dreadrul words causing the hair to stand on end.
All of you shall live on earth for a thousand years, like the sons of Vasishta feeding on the flesh of dogs".
Viswamitra the best of ascetics, thus cursed his sons. Sunassepha, (now) was filled with distress. To relieve him of his pain he said:
"Bedaubing your person with red sandal paste and adorned with red garlands, you will be bound to a Vaishnava, sacrificial post with sacred ropes. There invoke Agni with these hymns.
O Son of sage chant thse two sacred mantras in the sacrifice of Ambarisha.There after you will achieve success (long life)".
Sunassepha memorized the two verses with concentration of mind and hastened towards Amabarisha, a lion among kings. And said:
"Endowed with great strength, you are a lion among kings. We shall go to the sacrificial assembly without delay. O Indra among monarchs, take up initiatory rites and  perform the sacrifice".
At the words of the sage's son, the king, eager with delight hastened towards the sacrificial ground.
With the consent of the officiating priests the king invested Sunasepha with the sacred symbols with Kusa grass, dressed him in red apparel and tied him to the sacrificial post as a sacrificial animal.
Thus bound, the son of the sage praised the two devatas, Indra and Upendra with moving words.
"O Descendant of Raghu (Rama) Indra, gratified with the secret hymn granted Sunassepha long life.
O Foremost of men O Rama the king also obtained from the sacrifics innumerable rewards by the grace of Indra several times greater than expected.
O Best among men the righteous and mighty ascetic Viswamitra also continued his austerities at Pushkara for a thousand years".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्विषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixtysecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
All the gods wanted to bestow the fruits of austerties on the mighty ascetic (Viswamitra). They approached him after a thousand years of penace and his final ritual bath.
Exceedingly effulgent Brahma spoke to him, "You have become a rishi through the selfearned sacred deeds. Fare you well".
Brahma, the lord of the gods, having said this returned to heaven. The brilliant Viswamitra continues his austerities.
"O Foremost of men after a long lapse of time a chief nymph called Menaka came to bathe at Pushkara.
There the most brilliant son of Kusika Viswamitra saw Menaka whose beauty was incomparable. She looked like lightning in the clouds.
On seeing her (Menaka) Viswamitra came under the influence of the god of love (fell in love with her). He said, O Apsara welcome to my hermitage stay here. I am infatuated with you: Oblige me. Wish you well.
"O Descendant of Raghu while that woman of an exalted race lived in the hermitage of Viswamitra, ten years rolled by happily".
As the period passed, Viswamitra the mighty ascetic was filled with grief, anxiety and remorse.
O Delight of the Raghus (Rama) a sense of indignation filled the mind of the ascetic. 'All this is the conspiracy of the gods to deprive me of my great austerities', he thought.
Night and day deluded by lust I have wasted ten years. A hindrance has been posed (to my tapas).
"O Rama Viswamitra, the best of ascetics sighed with repentance, distressed with grief. On seeing him, the apsara started trembling in fear. She stood before him with folded palms. (But) with sweet words the son of Kushika left her and proceeded towards the northern mountains.
Illustrious Viswamitra took a vow of celibacy in order to control his senses. And performed rigid austerities on reaching the bank of river Kausiki.
O Rama while he was performing rigorous penance for a thousand years on the northern mountains, the gods were gripped with fear. (lest he should exceed them).
After consultations the gods and sages decided that this son of Kushika (Viswamitra)  deserved the status of a Maharshi".
Having heard the gods, the Grandsire of the worlds (Brahma) addressed  Viswamitra whose wealth was his ascetism in these sweet words.
"O Maharshi O Child welcome Pleased with your intense austerities, O Son of Kushika I confer upon you the eminent rank of a great rishi (maharshi)".
Having heard the words Brahman, the lord of all the worlds, Viswamitra whose wealth was his asceticism was neither dejected nor delighted.
Then the mighty ascetic Viswamitra bowed to Brahma, the Grandsire of all the worlds with folded hands and replied:
"O Adorable one, if you have conferred the incomparable title of 'Maharshi' earned by my auspicious deeds, I feel I have conquered the senses."
Then Brahma said to him, 'You have not conquered the senses yet. O Tiger among ascetics, strive still.' Having said this he went toward heaven.
After the departure of the gods, mighty ascetic Viswamitra raised his arms up, stood without support, subsisting on air, continuing with his austerities.
Viswamitra whose wealth was his penance carried on his rigid austerities for a thousand years amidst five fires, in summer, under the open sky in monsoon, and   immersed in ater night and day in winter.
When the mighty asetic Viswamitra was peforming penance, the gods as well as Indra  got deeply perturbed.
Indra along with all the maruts spoke to the celestial nymph Rambha, words that augured well for them and not for kaushika (Viswamitra).इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे त्रिषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixtythird sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rambha you must entice Viswamitra by lust and passion. This important work must be done by you in the interest of the gods".
O Rama, to these words of the sagacious, thousandeyed Lord of the gods (Indra) that apsara with folded hands bashfully replied:
'Lord of the devatas this mighty ascetic Viswamitra is a terrible person. He will ceratinly release on his dreadful anger (curse me). O Lord this is my apprehension. You should excuse me'.
O Rama having heard Rambha trembling in fear and standing with folded palms, Indra spoke:
'O Rambha have no fear. Feel safe. Carry out my order. When the trees look so beautiful in spring I shall in captivating the form of a cuckoo, stay by your side in the company of Kamadeva (Cupid).
O Rambha displaying many (romantic) gestures and assuming a fascinating form, distract the mighty ascetic, Kausika (Viswamitra)'.
At these words (of Indra), Rambha, assumed any form of excellent beauty and with a bright smile set out to allure Viswamitra.
Excited by the charming warble of the cuckoo, Viswamitra opened his eyes.
On hearing the sound of the incomparable song of the cuckoo along with the  sight of Rambha, a doubt arose in the mind of the ascetic.
Son of Kushika, the eminent ascetic knew it was the work of Indra. Seized with anger, he cursed Rambha:
'O luckless Rambha, since you have endeavoured to distract me from my desire to conquer  wrath and passion, you shall turn into a rock and remain so for ten thousand years'.
'O Rambha an effulgent brahmin, endowed with the power of asceticism, will liberate you from this state into which you have fallen on account of my anger'.
The brilliant Viswamitra, the great ascetic, now experienced remorse for his inability to contain anger.
This mighty curse, of the great saint transformed Rambha into a rock and sent Kamadeva and Indra to their heels.
"O Rama highly powerful Viswamitra was deprived of his ascetic merit due to his anger. He had no peace of mind for his inability to control his senses.
Having been deprived of his ascetic merit, he resolved not to lose his temper nor ever breathe a word".
"Further, I shall not even inhale for hundreds of years. I shall conquer my senses and dry up this body.
Until brahminhood is obtained by my austerities, I shall stay without breathing or eating for innumerable years. While performing penance, my limbs shall not undergo deterioration".
"O Descendant of Raghu in this way that eminent ascetic took an unprecedented vow to practise penance for a thousand years".   इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुष्षष्टितमस्सर्ग:।। Thus ends the sixtyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rama thereafter the great ascetic (Viswamitra), abandoning the north of the Himavat mountain reached the eastern quarter and performed rigorous austerities.
Having observed a unique vow of silence for a thousand years, O Rama he practised unprecedented and extremely difficult austerities.
After completion of a thousand years the great ascetic became a piece of wood. In spite of many impediments, he was unshaken, anger did not enter into his mind. O Rama with firm determination he practised  austerities.
O Best of Raghus dynasty (Rama) when the thousandyearold vow was over (Viswamitra) the great practitioner of vows began to partake cooked rice. At this moment Indra assumed the guise of a brahmin and asked him for the rice (he was going to eat).
This mighty, adorable ascetic having adopted a vow of silence decided to give all the cooked rice to the Brahmin. The brahmin finished all the rice. Viswamitra went without food but did not utter a single word to the brahmin. Thereafter the distinguished ascetic practised austerities for another period of thousand years, his breath suspended.
While his breath, was suspended, smoke emanated from his head which frightened the three worlds. It appeared as though they were on fire.
Thereupon devatas along with gandharvas, pannagas, uragas, and rakshasas, stood bewildered by his ascetic energy. Their own glory was dimmed in his lustre". Afflicted with anguish, they spoke to the Grandsire (Brahma):
"O Lord the great sage Viswamitra was lured and angered in various ways. But his austerities continued to grow:
His penance was flawless. If his wishes were not granted, he will  surely destroy by his austerities the three worlds with all movables and immovables.
There is bewilderment everywhere. It is dark all over. The oceans are disturbed. The mountains have cracked.
O Brahma the earth trembles. The wind blows fiercely. The people have ceased to believe in God. We do not know the way out.
The people of all the three worlds are agitated and confused in mind. The Sun, too, looks pale before the brilliance of the Maharshi.
O Lord before this mighty, venerable ascetic, effulgent like fire decides to destroy the three worlds, he should be appeased.
All the three worlds are burning as though with the fire Pralaya (dissolution). His desire may be granted even if he wants to rule the kingdom of the gods.
Thereafter, with Brahma in the forefront, the gods spoke to Viswamitra in pleasing words:
"Welcome, O Brahmarshi. We are immensely pleased with your austerities. O Kausika you have attained brahminhood by means of your intense penance.
O Brahmana I along with the maruts grant you long life. May you prosper O Gentle one now you may go happily".
Mighty ascetic Viswamitra was delighted to hear the words of the Grandsire and the gods. Bowing to all of them he thus spoke:
"If brahminhood and long life have been acquired by me by your grace, Omkara, Vashatkara and the Vedas shall accept me as Brahmarshi. (I shall acquire the right to interpret the Vedas and to perform sacrifices.)
"O gods let the son of Brahma and eminent Vasishta who is knowledgeable in the vedas worthy of brahmins and archery worthy of kshatriyas address me as 'Brahmarshi'. If this supreme desire is granted, O Best of devatas all of you can go".
Thereupon, pleased by the gods, Vasishta, the best among ascetics, lovingly said to Viswamitra "You are a Brahmarshi, let it be so".
"You are a Brahmarshi, no doubt. You will achieve ascetic perfection", said the gods and returned to their respective places from where they had come.
Virtuous Viswamitra also, having attained excellent brahminhood, worshipped  Brahmrshi Vasishta who was the best of those who recite hymns".
This illustrious sage having fulfilled his desire, wandered over the earth fixed in asceticism. O Rama  thus he acquired brahminhood.
O Rama he is the foremost of ascetics, an embodiment of asceticism, always intent on virtue. He is the ultimate repository of ascetic energy".
Having thus spoken, the most brilliant and best among brahmins (Satananda) became silent. In the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, Janaka listened to the words of Satananda. And with folded palms said to the son of Kushika (Viswamitra):
"O Righteous one O Preeminent among ascetics you have come to my sacrifice accompanied by the descendants of Kakustha (Rama and Lakshmana). I am  blessed by your presence and am   highly favoured.
O Excellent ascetic O Brahmana I am sanctified with your presence. I have derived immense benefits from your visit.
O powerful  Brahmarshi distinguished Rama and I have heard your great austerities which were related in detail (by Satananda).
Many of your virtues have been heard by the members of the assembly present at the  sacrifice. Your austerities are immeasurable, your power is immense. O Son of Kushika (Viswamitra), your virtues cannot be measured.
O Lord I am never tired of listening to your marvellous deeds. O Excellent among ascetics the Sun has set and it is time for evening prayers.
O Sage of great austerities come to me tomorrow at dawn. O Excellent ascetic welcome And allow me to leave".
The day dawned bright and clear when the king (Janaka) performed his daily routine rites and welcomed the great Viswamitra with the two Raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana).
The virtuous Janaka paid respects to Viswamitra and the highsouled Rama and Lakshmana in accordance with the sastras and spoke:
"Welcome, O Venerable one O Irreproachable one what can I do for you? Worthy of being commanded, I seek your orders.
At the words of the magnanimous Janaka, the virtuous sage wellversed in speech replied to the heroic king:
Dasaratha's sons, (Rama and Lakshmana), kshatriyas renowned in the world are eager to see that great bow in your possession.
Thus addressed by the mighty ascetic Janaka replied, "I shall tell you how this bow came to be deposited here".
"O Adorable one there was a famous king named Devarata, sixth in line from Nimi. This bow was kept with him in trust by the exalted lord (Shiva).
Earlier at the time of destruction of Daksha's sacrifice, Rudra endowed with  great prowess lifted this bow sportively and spoke to the gods.
'O gods in your anxiety to partake your share of the sacrifie, you have failed to provide mine in the sacrificial offerings. Therefore, I shall sever your jewelled heads and beautiful limbs with this bow'.
"O Eminent ascetic thereafter all the gods with agitated minds propitiated lord of the gods, Siva and he was pleased with them.
O Lord that gem of a bow belonging to Siva was given to the great gods who in turn got it deposited in trust with our ancestor.
Thereupon while I was ploughing and cleaing the (sacrificial) ground, Sita, a wellknown name, was lifted up by the blade of the plough. Thus she was obtained by me.
Arisen from the earth and not from a mother's womb, she grew up as my daughter. I made a stipulation that (this shall be the means to win this maiden as a gift) this shall be given in marriage only to the prince whose prowess is fully tried.
O Eminent ascetic arisen from the earth and reared as my daughter, she has been sought after in marriage by many princes.
O Worshipful one all those monarchs sought this maiden but I did not offer my daughter saying that the 'marriage offer' could be made only through the tried and tested prowess of a suitor.
O Preeminent among ascetics thereafter many kings together came to Mithila to test their prowess.
The bow was brought and placed before those who were curious to test their strength but none was able to grasp or lift the bow.
O great ascetic I knew those mighty kings had little strength, so rejected them.
O Mighty ascetic, thereafter all the kings doubting their own strength in stringing the bow were inflamed with anger and laid siege on Mithila.
Those eminent kings felt humiliated. Inflamed with anger, they tormented the city of Mithila.
O Best among ascetics thus one year passed. Everywhere in the city all the means of living were exhausted. I felt deeply sad over this situation.
Thereafter, I propitiated the gods by my austerities. Highly pleased, they gave me an army of four divisions (chariots, elephants, horses and infantry ).
Then those wicked kings who were exhausted were doubtful about their energy. They were beaten and defeated. They fled away along with their ministers in different directions.
O Sage you are a tiger among asceties, you are faithful to your vows, I shall show this effulgent bow to your Rama and Lakshmana .
O Sage if Rama could lift and string this bow I shall give my daughter Sita, not born from a woman, to him (son of Dasaratha)".  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्षष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixtysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
At the words of Janaka, great ascetic Viswamitra said to the king, "Let the bow be shown to Rama".
Thereafter king Janaka said to his feudatories, "Let the divine bow adorned with flowers and sandalpaste be brought".
Commanded by (king) Janaka, the ministers went to the city, put the bow in front of them and carried it as per the orders of the king.
Five thousand mighty stalwarts drew with great difficulty the eightwheeled cart on which the bow was placed in a box.
The counsellors of the king, brought the iron casket containing the bow and said these words to Janaka comparable to a celestial:
'O Indra among kings O lord of Mithila here is the great bow, worshipped by all kings, which you intend to show (to Rama)'.
Having heard this, the king with folded hands said to the great soul Viswamitra sitting with the two princes Rama and Lakshmana:
"O Brahman in the olden days, this great bow was worshipped by my forefathers. Powerful kings failed to string this bow.
Hosts of devatas, asuras, rakhasas, kinnaras and great serpents, the best of gandharvas and yakshas, also failed (to wield this bow).
How then can men bend, string, fix the arrow, pull the string and lift it?
O Eminent ascetic such heaviest bow is brought here, O Highly accomplished sage show this to the two princes".
Having heard the words of Janaka, the righteous Viswamitra said: "O Child O Descendant of Raghu look at this bow".
At the words of the great rishi Viswamitra, Rama opened the casket, beheld  the bow and said:
"O Brahmarshi, shall I touch this great bow with my hands lift and string it".
The king as also the rishi said "Be it so". At the words of the sage (Viswamitra), he (Rama) took hold of the bow by the its middle with ease:
Virtuous Rama, the delight of the Raghus, in the presence of several thousands of men fixed the string to the bow and drew it as though with ease.
Rama, the best among men, righteous and famous lifted the bow. Stringing it with a twang he drew it and broke it into two in the middle.
It generated a loud sound like the clap of thunder, like the trembling of the earth and the splitting of a mountain.
On hearing the sound, except Janaka, Viswamitra and the two raghavas (Rama and Lakshmana) the rest of the people around fell down and fainted.
When the people recovered the king skilful in the use  of words addressed the eminent ascetic  without apprehension with folded palms in the following words:
"O Worshipful one I have witnessed the prowess of Rama, son of Dasaratha. I had not imagined that this marvellous feat could be ever accomplished.
By receiving Rama, son of Dasaratha, as her husband, my daughter Sita will bring glory to my dynasty.
O Son of Kausika I announce Sita to be the 'Reward of prowess'. My vow has come true. She is more valuable than my life and fit to be given to Rama.
O Brahmarshi Kausika, be blessed With your consent my ministers will take the chariots to Ayodhya immediately.
That Sita, the reward of prowess is to be given to Rama be reventially communicated in detail to king Dasaratha and he may be conveyed here.
The welfare of the descendant of Kausika (Rama and Lakshmana) under the protection of sage (Viswamitra) be reported to the king. The king who will be happy to hear this be brought here by swiftfooted men".
The son of Kausika (Viswamitra) also said, "So be it". The virtuous king, having consulted his ministers, despatched counsellors to Ayodhya to communicate to king Dasaratha all that had taken place and bring him (to Mithila).इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे सप्तषष्टितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixtyseventh sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Commanded by Janaka the messengers travelled for three days, rested for three nights on the way and entered the city of Ayodhya along with their horses tired.
Reaching the king's palace the messengers said to the doorkeepers, "Let king Dasaratha be immediately informed that the messengers from Janaka have come".
Having heard their words, the doorkeepers informed the descendant of Raghu (king Dasaratha). Thereafter, with the the king's permission, the messengers entered the royal palace  and beheld the aged king Dasaratha who shone like a god.
All the messengers, hands folded free from apprehensions, reverentially addressed the king in sweet words.
"O Great monarch Mithila's lord, king Janaka, with the sacred fire in front again and again enquires about your health and the spiritual wellbeing of your preceptors, priests and attendants in words filled with sweetness and affection.
Janaka, the king of Mithila with the enquiry about your welfare, with the permission of the son of Kausika (Viswamitra) sends you this message:
O King It is wellknown that formerly I had vowed to give my daughter to a groom as a reward for prowess. Disappointed when proved powerless, the kings became indignant and opposed me.
O King that this daughter of mine has been won by your heroic son Rama  who has come here casually led by Viswamitra.
O Great king, Dasaratha the divine bow with its limitless glory was broken in the middle by the great self Rama in the assembly of people.
Sita is fit to be given in marriage to this eminent Rama as a reward for his prowess. I request you to give your consent to fulfil my vow.
O Mighty king be blessed. Come here soon with your preceptors and priest. You ought to be reumitd with Rama amd Lakshmana.
O Indra among kings you will not only bring me pleasure, you will also be happy to see your sons.
The king of Videha (Janaka) with Viswamitra's approval and in line with Satananda's thinking has conveyed these sweet words". The messengers having said so concluded  out of respect for their king (afraid that they might look overtalkative).
Exceedingly happy to hear the words of the messengers, the king said to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other ministers.
"The enhancer of the joy of Kausalya (Rama) along with hs brother Lakshmana under the protection of  Viswamitra  is now staying in the coutry of the Videhas."
Illustrious Janaka desires to bestow his daughter on the descendat of Kakustha (Rama) whose prowess he has witnessed.
If you approve the action, of the distinguished Janaka, let us hurry to the city of Mithila. Let there be no delay".
With the passing of the night king Dasaratha, accompanied by spiritual preceptors and relatives said to Sumantra:
"Let all the officers of the treasury furnished with enough wealth and a variety gems go in advance under escort.
Let the four divisions of the army from all the four quarters with elegant palanquins proceed at my command.
Let brahmins like Vasishta, Vamadeva, Jabali, Kasyapa, Markandeya endowed with long life, and rishi Katyayana depart in advance. My chariot be yoked and kept ready. Let there be no delay. The messengers (from Janaka) are hastening me up".
While the Indra among kings (Dasaratha) proceeded with the sages, the four divisions of the army followed them at the command of the king.
Covering the distance in four days, they arrived in the country of the Videhas. The fortunate king Janaka, having heard about these tidings, made arangements to extend to them reverential hospitality.
King Janaka approached the aged ruler of men, Dasaratha, and experienced great delight.
Filled with joy the best of men (Janaka) addreseed the best of men Dasaratha: "O Descendant of the Raghus, O Great king welcome I am fortunate to have you, you will experience the pleasure of both your sons having won the  reward for their prowess.
Most brilliant and adorable ascetic Vasishta surrounded by the foremost of brahmins like Indra by the gods has also arrived by the grace of God.
By the grace of god, I have overcome all impediments. By the grace of God my race  has been honoured through alliance with the house of the Raghus distinguished by their valour.
O Foremost of men, O Best of kings, tomorrow at dawn after the completion of the sacrifice, you should perform the marriage with approval by the sages".
At these words, the most eloquent king (Dasaratha) made his reply in the midst of sages:
"I have heard that acceptance of a gift from the righteous is a pleasure. So we will act upon your word".
Janaka was filled with extreme admiration to hear one who was truthful, righteous and famous (this Dasaratha).
Thereupon hosts of sages in one another's company, filled with great delight spent the night comfortably.
The king (Dasaratha) was greatly delighted on being reunited with his sons Rama and Lakshmana. Honoured by Janaka, he spent the night with supreme satisfaction.
Mighty philosopher Janaka also performed the  sacrificial rites and spent the night (there where the sacrificial ceremony was performed) with both his daughters.  इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकोनसप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the sixtynineth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Thereafter at dawn after the maharshis had performed their daily (sacrificial) rites the eloquent Janaka said to the chief priest Satananda:
"The extremely righteous, renowned and most brilliant Kusadhwaja, my younger brother is (at present) ruling the sacred kingdom of Sankasya, which is like the aerial chariot Pushpaka, with darts planted in water as boundary on the bank of the auspicious, sacred river Ikshumati.
I desire to see Kusadhwaja who I have accepted as the protector of the sacrifice. I want that my glorious brother should share this pleasure, with me".
Janaka having said so in the presence of Satananda gave instructions to a few faithful  attendants who were present.
In obedience to the command of Indra among men (king Janaka), the messengers rode away on swift horses to bring king Kusadhwaja, a tiger among men just like fetching Visnu by the orders of Indra.
The messengers reached Sankasya, met Kusadhwaja and related to him what had happened. They informed him the intention of (king) Janaka.
Kusadhwaja having heard the events from the loyal, mighty messengers set out for Mithila in compliance with the request of the king (Janaka).
There he saw the highsouled Janaka devoted to righteousness. Having paid his regards to Satananda and the virtuous king he occupied an exalted seat befitting a king.
The two heroic brothers endowed with great splendour seated beside each other, despatched Sudamana the wisest of ministers (to Dasaratha).
"O Foremost among counsellors, go speedily and bring along with his ministers and sons the invincible Dasaratha of the Ikshvakus dynasty whose splendour is immeasurable".
Having reached the tent, he (Sudamana) saw Dasaratha, perpetuator of the race of the Raghus and bowing down his head, said:
"O Heroic lord of Ayodhya, Janaka, the lord of Mithila desires to see you along with preceptors and priest".
King Dasaratha on hearing the words of the best of the counsellors reached the place where Janaka was waiting with hosts of rishis and relations.
The king (Dasaratha), skilled in speech, accompanied by counsellors and kins said to Janaka,the lord of the Videhas:
"O Great king venerable Vasishta is the spiritual protector of the Ikshvakus race and it is known that for all ceremonies he is our spokesman".
"Having been permitted by Viswamitra, along with all maharshis virtuous Vasishta will tell you in detail about my race".
Having said this amidst the best of men and the most distinguished among kings, Dasaratha remained silent. Then Vasishta, the venerable sage, wellversed in speech spoke to the Lord of Videhas (Janaka) in the midst of priests.
"From the unmanifest was born the eternal, the constant, the imperishable Brahma. To him was born Marichi and to Marichi, Kasyapa.
Kasyapa begot Vivasvan and Vivasvan, Manu. Ikshavaku was the son of Manu otherwise called Prajapati or Vaivasvata.
It may be noted that Ikshvaku was the first ancestral king of Ayodhya whose son was the wellknown, glorious Kukshi.
Prosperous Vikukshi was Kukshi's son, who brought forth brilliant and powerful Bana.
Bana's son was the most brilliant and valiant Anaranya whose son Pruthu was succeeded by Trisanku.
Trisanku's famous son was Dundumara also known as Yuvanashva whose son was king Mandhata.
Mandhata's son was prosperous Susandhi who brought forth two sons Dhruvasandhi and Prasenajit.
To Dhruvasandhi was born the wellknown Bharata who begot the vigorous Asita.
Valiant kings belonging to the races of the Haihayas, Talaiangha, and Sasibindus   became  the enemies to Asita.
The king Asita who was a weakling was defeated in the conflict against the kings and was exiled. Along with his counsellors he lived at on the Bhriguprasravana Himavat mountain.
It is said that his (Asita's) two wives were pregnant. One gave food mixed with poison to the other with the intention of destroying her embryo.
At that time Chyavana of the family of Bhrigu liked to stay at Himavat, the great, pleasant mountain.
That the lotuseyed and highly accomplished Kalindi, offered herself for a son to Chyavana who was glowing like a god.
Having approached the ascetic. Kalindi paid obeisance to him who said:
'O Great lady a child of high prowess, lustre and virtues is growing in your womb. In a short time this glorious son carrying with him the poison (administered to you) will be born. O Lotuseyed lady, do not grieve'.
This eldest queen who was a devoted wife, afflicted with sorrow due to loss of her husband  gave birth to a son by the grace of  Chyavana.
Since poison was given to her by  her rival queen with the intention of destroying the   embryo, the son was born with poison and so came to be known as Sagara.
Asamanja was the son of Sagara and to him was born Anshuman. Dilipa was the son of Anshuman and father of Bhagiratha.
Bhagiratha begot Kakustha whose son was Raghu. Powerful Pravriddha was Raghu's son. He became Purushadaka (cannibal), on the curse of Vasistha. He grasped water in order to retaliate Vasishta but was prevented by  his wife. The water fell on his feet and he came to be known as Kalmashapada (feet polluted with water). Samkhana was born to him.
Sudarsana was the son of Samkhana. His son was Agnivarna. To Agnivarna was  born Sighraga and to Sighraga, Maru. To Maru, was born Prasusruka and to Prasrusuka, Ambarisha.
King Nahusha was the son of  Ambarisha. To Nahusha was born Yayati whose son was Nabhaga.
Nabhaga's son was Aja. Aja was the father of Dasaratha and Dasaratha, the father of  Rama and Lakshmana.
Vasishta having thus described (the genealogy of Dasaratha) Janaka with folded hands rejoined, "Be blessed. Let me relate the genealogy  of my race. Listen".
"O Great sage O Best of ascetics while one offers his daughter (in marriage), one born in a noble family should describe his genealogy in full. Listen.
There was a great man of religion king Nimi, strongest of men and wellknown in the three worlds by his own acts.
Nimi begot a son named Mithi who constructed Mithila. He was the first Janaka whose son was Udavasu.
Virtuous Nandivardhana was the son of Udavasu whose son was Suketu.
Suketu's son was the righteous and powerful Devarata, father of Brihadradha.
Brihadradha's son was the heroic and powerful Mahavira, father of Sudhruti, who was armed with courage and the power of truth.
To Sudhruti was born the righteous Drishtaketu, committed to dharma. Rajarshi Drishtaketu was father to the wellknown Haryasva.
Haryasva's son was Maru, father of Pratindhaka. Pratindhaka's son was the righteous king Kirtiratha.
The son of Kirtiratha was known as Devamidha. His son was Vibudha, father of Mahidhraka.
Mighty king Kirtirata was the son of Mahidhraka. He was a Rajarshi, father of Maharoma.
To Maharoma's was born the virtuous Swarnaroma. Swarnaroma's son was Hrasvaroma.
Hrasvaroma, was a religious king. He was a great soul. Of his two sons. I am the eldest and valiant Kusadhwaja is my younger brother.
My father king Hrasvaroma crowned me king, entrusted Kusadhwaja to my care and retired to the forest.
After my aged father attained heaven, I looked after my brother Kusadhwaja, who resembles the celestials, affectionately and ruled the kingdom with righteousness.
A little later a powerful king named Sudhanva from the city of Sankasya beseiged Mithila.
He (Sudhanva) sent me a message: 'give me the great bow of Siva and the lotuseyed maiden Sita'.
O Brahmarshi when I refused, a great conflict broke out between him and me. In the encounter king Sudhanva was killed by me.
O Best of ascetics having killed king Sudhanva, I have crowned my heroic brother Kusadhwaja in Sankasya.
O Great ascetic (Vasishta), this one is my youger brother and I am the elder one. O preeminent among ascetics with immense pleasure I am giving these maidens, Sita to Rama and Urmila to Lakshmana. Be blessed
I offer my daughter Sita, who looks like a celestial maiden as reward for (Rama's) prowess and my second daughter Urmila (to Lakshmana). I proclaim it three times so that there is no doubt about it.
O Delight of the Raghus (King Dasaratha), I offer these brides with immense pleasure to Rama and Lakshmana. You may perform the rites for your forefathers by gift of cows. Prosperity to you. Thereafter you may perform the marriage.
Today the star Makha is on the ascendant. O King perform the marriage on the, third day from today under UttaraPhalguni star. Gifts may be given for the happiness of Rama and Lakshmana".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे एकसप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the seventyfirst sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Janaka the valiant king of Videha thus spoke (on the genealogy of his family) the mighty ascetic Viswamitra accompanied by Vasishta said to Janaka:
"O Preeminent among men the glory of the two races of Ikshvakus as also of Videhas is in comprehensible and immeasurable. There is none equal to these kings of the Ikshvakus and Videhas.
O King it is a perfect match between Sita and Rama and Urmila and Lakshmana. In respect of piety and beauty  the match is perfect.
O Best of men my words deserve to be heard. This younger brother king Kusadhwaja is knower of righteousness.
O King, O Eminent among men we seek the hands of this virtuous king's two daughters, unrivalled in beauty, on earth, as consorts.
O king we choose your brother's daughters for the great souls: the young Bharata and the sagacious Satrughna.
Bestowed with youth and beauty, these sons of Dasaratha resemble kings in defending the worlds and gods in valour.
O King of kings (Janaka) the bond between your race with its pious deeds and the Ikshvakus  may be strenghthened by this alliance".
Having heard the words of Viswamitra which echoed the wish of Vasishta, Janaka replied to the eminent ascetics with folded palms.
"Since both of you, eminent ascetics, recomended this befitting alliance of the two races on your own, I regard my race as blessed.
"Let it be so, Be blessed Let these two daughters of Kusadhwaja (Mandavi and Srutakirti) be the wives of Satrughna and Bharata respectively and serve them.
O Great ascetic let the valiant four princes take the hands of four princesses on the same day.
"The wise, O Brahmin think the marriage is favourable when Bhaga is Prajapati on the succeeding day of the ascent of the two stars. (that is, when poorva is followed by uttara phalguni).
King Janaka, having spoken these pleasing words, stood up and with folded hands  addressing both the great ascetics:
"You have earned me a great religious merit. I shall be always your disciple O Eminent ascestics, occupy these important seats".
"Dasaratha has right on the city of Ayodhya as much as I have on this. This right is unquestionable. So do whatever you think right".
To the words of Janaka, king of Videha, king Dasaratha, the descendant of Raghu cheerfully replied:
"You both brothers are lords of Mithila. You possess countless virtues. You pay regards to  many rishis and hosts of kings".
"Be safe. Be blessed. Let me retire to the camp. I have to perform the rites offerings to the forefathers".
Then renowned king Dasaratha, took leave of the two great ascetics. Then the rowned king Dasaratha took have of the king (Janaka) immediately following the two great ascetics.
The king (Dasaratha) reached the abode, performed the sharaddha ceremony in accordance with the scriptures. Next day at dawn at appropriate time he gifted away cows (a ceremony performed by initiating the bridegrooms into the marriage.)
For the welfare of each of his sons the king (Dasaratha) religiously gave away a hundred thousand cows to brahmins.
Great among men and affectionate towards his children, (king Dasaratha), the delight of the Raghus donated in the name of his sons' donates to the brahmins four hundred thousand cows. They were capable of abundance of milk. Their horns were plaited with gold. They were accompanied by calves. With them were given away bellmetal vessels for keeping milk and innumerable valuables.
With his sons for whose sake cows have been given away the cheerful king looked like  shining Prajapati surrrounded by the guardians of the world.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे द्विसप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the seventhsecond sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
The day the king (Dasaratha) made a gift of the best (available) cows the heroic Yudhajit arrived.
Yudhajit, son of king Kekaya, Bharata's own maternal uncle met the king (Dasaratha) and enquiring about his wellbeing said:
"My father, king of Kekaya affectionately enquires about your welfare. And they whose welfare you seek  are hale and healthy.
The king of Kekaya, O Indra among kings, O Joy of the Raghus, desires to see my  sisters's son and on that account I went to Ayodhya.
O King having heard in Ayodhya that you have arrived in Mithila along with your sons for their marriage I came here speedily with a desire to see my sister's son .
King Dasaratha, then accorded a warm welcome to the honoured guest.
With the night spent with his virtuous sons, he who knew his duties got up at dawn and performed his daily devotionas and reached the sacrificial place following the  rishis.
With the necessary auspicious rites preparatory to marriage performed at an auspicious moment, Vijaya, and keeping Vasishta and other maharshis in the forefront,  Rama accompanied by his brothers adorned with ornaments of every kind came into his  father's presence.
Adorable Vasishta approached king Janaka and said, "O King, of Videha king Dasaratha, the best of men with his sons having performed the auspicious rites preparatory to marriage is awaiting the bestower of the brides".
The giver and the receiver, indeed, attain all ends. Fulfil  your own duty by performing the auspicious marriage".
Thus addressed by the great self Vasishta, Janaka, the exceedingly generous, highly lustrous, eminent in ethics replied.
"Did any guard prevent you? Whose command are you waiting for? Why do you hesitate to enter into your own house? This kingdom is like your kingdom".
O Best of ascetics my daughters have performed all the rites relating to marriage. They (now) stand at the foot of the altar shining like the bright flames of fire.
Ready at the altar, I have been awaiting you, O King Without hindrance proceed Why delay?".
At the words of Janaka, Dasaratha brought his sons along with the hosts of ascetics and entered the marriage pavilion.
Thereafter the king of the Videhas to Vasishta, "O Adherent of righteousness, O Lord O Maharshi perform with the rishis the marriage ceremony of Rama who causes delight to the three worlds".
Venerable and renowned ascetic Vasishta said "Be it so".And with Viswamitra and virtuous Satananda in the forefront, an altar was duly improvised in the centre of the sacrificial pavilion. He adorned the altar on all sides  with fragrant flowers, golden ladles, waterpots with holes filled with sprouts, earthen vessels with sprouts, holders of burning fragrant incense conchshaped vessels, sacrificial ladles, bowls filled with with water for arghya and other purposes, vessels with roasted paddy and grains of rice.
Brilliant and worshipful rishi Vasishta chanted, mantras according to tradition, put the darbha grass of equal proportions around the altar, placed the fire on the altar, recited the mantras from the scriptures and offered oblations into the flame.
Thereafter king Janaka brought Sita adorned with various ornaments and placed her in the presence of Agni in front of Rama, the enhancer of the joy of Kausalya. And said:
"This my daughter Sita will be your partner in performing her rightful duty. Accept her. Farewell. Take her hand into your own.
By being a devoted wife this highly fortunate Sita would always follow you like a shadow". Thus spoken, he sprinkled the water sanctified with mantras (on them).
Then gods and sages exclaimed: 'well, well'. Celestial kettledrums were sounded and there was a steady rain of flowers.
Then king Janaka sprinkled on Sita waters sanctified by mantras, and immersed in delight said:
"Lakshmana come and accept my daughter. Urmila ready to be bestowed upon you by me. Take her hand. Let there be no delay".
Janaka, having spoken thus to Lakshmana addressed Bharata: "O Descendant of the Raghus hold Mandavi's hand in your own".
The righteous king Janaka, said again: "O Mightyarmed Satrughna take the hands of Srutakirti".
O Descendants of Kakustha (Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna) you all are gentle. You possess sound character. You are true to your vows. Live with your wives. Let there be no delay".
At the words of Janaka the four princes took the hands of the four sisters with their own with the consent of Vasishta .
The great, noble princes of the race of Raghu, accompanied by their wives circumambulated the altar of the sacred fire. King Janaka and the sages in obedience to the directions of Vasishta and in accordance with the sastras conducted the matrimonial.
While the descendants of Kakustha (Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna) held the elegant hands (of Sita, Urmila, Mandavi, and Srutakirti) there was a heavy rain of bright flowers from the sky.
Night over, the great ascetic Viswamitra, profusely blessed the princes born in the race of Raghu, took leave of the two kings and set out towards the northern (Himalayas) mountains.
With the departure of Viswamitra, king Dasaratha who was the source of happiness to his subjects took leave of Janaka, king of Mithila and speedily set out for the city of Ayodhya.
King Janaka, lord of the Videhas, gave plenty of gifts to his daughters and followed king Dasaratha for some distance on his journey to Ayodhya.
The king of Mithila and father of the brides gave a hundred thousand cows, excellent woollen carpets, crores of silk garments, four divisions of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry and welldecorated, excellent male and  maidservants shining in celestial beauty.
Immensely delighted, he gave his excellent daughters gold, pearls and corals.
The Lord of Mithila bestowed a lot of wealth on his daughters and with the consent of the king (Dasaratha) reentered his residence in Mithila.
King Dasaratha of Ayodhya also left along with his great sons preceded by the sages and followed by the army.
While this tiger among men Dasaratha, was returning with the hosts of sages and his sons, he observed here and there frightening birds making disagreeable sounds.
Seeing the beasts on the way rushing to the right the tiger among men, enquired of Vasishta:
"While the frightening birds are inauspicious, the deer on the right are favourables Why is this? My heart beats. My mind is depressed.
To these words of king Dasaratha the great ascetic Vasishta replied in a gentle voice, "I shall tell you the consequences Listen".
The dreadful cries from the mouths of birds foretell an event of celestial nature likely to befall but the movements other of deer indicate restoration of peace. Therefore do not grieve.
While they were conversing, a storm blew, shaking the earth and felling down beautiful trees.
The Sun was wrapped in dark. The quarters were devoid of brightness. The entire army was covered with ashes, as if they fainted.
At that time Vasishta and other saints, the king and his sons held their senses under control. All others lost their consciousness.
In that dreadful darkness while the army looked as if covered with ashes, king Dasaratha encountered the repressor of kings, descendant of Bhrugu and son of Jamadagni with a terrible crown of matted hair, inaccessible like Kailasa mountain and unendurable like the fire at the time of dissolution. The laymen gazing at his blazing energy,hanging an axe on his shoulder and holding a bow in his hand which flashed like lighning and the principal arrow he looked like Siva at the time of slaying of Tripura.
At the sight of the fearful appearance of Parasurama looking like flaming fire, Vasishta and all other saints who were in the habit of chanting mantras and offering oblations to the fire whispered among themselves:
Enraged at the slaughter of his father (by Kartaveeryarjuna), is he intent upon  exterminating the kshatriya race? Having slaughtered the kshatriyas, in the past he was freed from anger and grief. Is he again desirous of annihilating the kshatriyas?
The saints having thus talked amongst themselves, offered arghya to the son of Bhargava, of dreadful appearance and addressed him in soothing words: "O Rama O Rama".
Valiant Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, having accepted the homage offered by the saints addressed Rama, son of Dasaratha and said:इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे चतुस्सप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the seventyfourth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
"O Rama, Rama, son of Dasaratha I have heard in full of your marvellous prowess and your feat in breaking the bow of Siva.
The fact that you have broken Siva's bow is an astonishing act. It is beyond imagination. Having heard it I have come here with another auspicious bow.
This mighty, dreadful bow was obtained through Jamadagni. You may display your prowess by fixing on it an arrow.
O Rama after witnessing your strength in stretching and stringing this bow, I shall engage you in a duel acclaiming your prowess".
When king Dasaratha heard these words, his face fell. He humbly pleaded with him his hands folded:
"You are a brahmana, highly renowned and withdrawn from anger against kshatriyas. It behoves of you to give assurance of security to my sons who are young.
Born in the family of (saint) Bhrigu versed in the study of the Vedas and  observance of vows. You have promised in the name of  the thousandeyed Indra to renounce the arms.
By adhering to righteousness in life and having conferred the earth upon Kasyapa, you retired to the forest and made your residence on the Mahendra mountain.
O Great ascetic today you have arrived evidently for the total destruction of our family. If Rama is killed none of us will survive".
Disregarding these words of Dasaratha, the valiant son of Jamadagni said to Rama.
"These two excellent celestial bows are wellknown throughout the worlds. They are stout and strong. They are the best of all, wellmade by Visvakarma.
O Best among men O Descendant of Kakustha one of these broken by you, was given by the gods to the threeeyed Siva, who, wishing to fight the demon Tripura with this bow, destroyed him.
This second bow which is unassailable was given by chief of the celestials to Visnu. O Rama born in the race of Kakutstha this highly radiant bow of Visnu is as strong as the bow of Siva.
Then all the gods in order to ascertain the strength and weakness of Siva and Visnu enquired of the Grandsire, Brahma:
Foremost among the truthful, Grandsire Brahma come to know the intention of the gods and triggered a conflict between the gods.
In that thrilling fight between Siva and Visnu, each desirous of victory over the other, a ferocious battle took place causing one's hair to stand on end.
Then, with the 'Humkara' produced by Visnu, Siva's bow of dreadful prowess was stretched, which struck the threeeyed Mahadeva motionless.
Then hosts of sages, charanas and the gods assembled there and beseeched both of them, the preeminent among the gods to keep peace.
Now that the bow of Siva was made inert by Visnu's prowess, hosts of sages and  gods acknowlged Visnu as superior.
Glorious Siva, enraged at this, placed the bow together with the arrow in the hands of Rajarshi Devarata in the country of Videha.
This bow of Visnu, O Rama capable of conquering hostile cities, was given in trust to Richika belonging to the race of Bhrigu.
Brilliant Ruchika gave this bow to his son, the great Jamadagni, my father, a man of unrivalled valour.
My father equipped with ascetic energy renounced the weapon and was killed by Kartaveeryarjuna in a vulgar manner.
O Rama Having heard the slaying of my father incomparable in extreme ruthlessness, I decimated the Kshatriya race again and again out of fury as they were born and reborn. I conquered the entire earth. At the conclusion of the sacrifice I conferred it on the great soul Kasyapa of meritorious acts. Gifted with ascetic energy I have (now) made the Mahendra mountain my abode.
O Mighty Rama when I heard that you have broken the bow with your extraordinary prowess, I have come here quickly.
Respect the duties of a kshatriya, O Rama Take hold of this great, uncommon bow of Visnu inherited by me from my father and forefathers.
O Descendant of Kakustha this best bow is capable of conquering enemy cities. Fix an arrow. If it is possible for you to do so, then I shall engage you in a duel".इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे पञ्चसप्ततितमस्सर्ग: ।।Thus ends the seventyfifth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
Hearing the words of the son of Jamadagni (Parasurama), Rama, the son of Dasaratha, avoiding further conversation out of respect for his father intercepted Parasurama saying:
"O Descendant of Bhrigu I have listened to the (marvellous) acts you have performed. O Brahman I commend you for discharging your duty in repaying the debt to your father.
You underrate me O Bhargava as though I am devoid of valour and incompetent to perform the duties of a Kshatriya. Now witness my energy and valour.
Having spoken thus, the enraged Rama, gifted with quick vigour, seized the bow and arrow from Parasurama's hands.
Infuriated Rama bent the bow stretched it, fixed the arrow and addressed Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni:
"You are a brahmin, O Parasurama. You are also related to Viswamitra. Hence you are worthy of homage. I cannot, therefore, release this against you to take your life.
I shall destroy your mobility, O Parasurama or the higher worlds earned through your matchless asceteic energy. Tell me which one you choose.
On conquering the hostile cities and destroying the pride and strength of the enemy by its prowess, this celestial arrow of Visnu shall not go in vain".
The gods with the Grandsire, Brahma in the forefront, accompanied by sages in groups assembled there to see Rama holding that mighty bow. Gandharvas, apsaras, siddhas, charanas, kinnaras, yakshas, rakshsas and nagas also came there to witness that great wonder.
Then when Rama stretched the great bow, the world became motionless. The son of Jamadagni, Parasurama, bereft of prowess gazed at him with astonishment.
His energy subdued by Rama's prowess, the paralysed, Parasurama, son of Jamadagni spoke in gentle words to him whose eyes resembled the lotus petals:
"When I gave this entire earth to Kasyapa, he said to me, 'you shall not live in my country'.
O Descendant of Kakustha having gifted this earth to Kasyapa, I promised him that I would not live here, during night time. For the earth belongs to him.
For this, you should not destroy my mobility, O valiant son of the Raghus. I shall go to Mahendra, the best of mountains, with the speed of mind.
Strike with the, principal arrow the unrivalled worlds conquered by my asceticism. Do not delay, O Rama
By the fact that you have stretched this bow, I have come to know that you are Visnu, Lord of the gods, slayer of Madhu, O Imperishable one O Tormentor of enemies Fare well.
All your deeds are incomparable. You are unassailable in combat. All these hosts of gods have assembled here and are looking at you.
I have been defeated by you, O Descendant of Kakustha lord of the three worlds. Therefore, it is not right for me to feel ashamed.
You are faithful to vows O Rama This arrow has no equal in prowess. It behoves of you to release it against me. After its release I shall go to the excellent Mahendra  mountain".
Thus spoke  Parasurama, son of Jamadagni to Rama, the valiant son of Dasaratha who (then) discharged the principal arrow.
Having witnessed the destruction of those regions earned by him through asceticism, the son of Jamadagni left for the best of mountains Mahendra.
Thereafter all the quarters including the intermediaries were cleared of darkness. Hosts of sages and gods extolled Rama when he wielded the bow.
Parasurama, the competent son of Jamadagni, having praised Rama, the son of Dasaratha circumbulated him and left for his abode.इत्यार्षे श्रीमद्रामायणे वाल्मीकीय आदिकाव्ये बालकाण्डे षट्सप्ततितमस्सर्ग:।।Thus ends the seventysixth sarga of Balakanda of the holy Ramayana the first epic composed by sage Valmiki.
When Parasurama departed, Rama, son of Dasaratha with a serene mind gave the bow along with the arrow to Varuna of immeasurable strength.
Thereafter Rama the descendant of the Raghus, paid obeisance to Vasishta and other rishis, and looked at his father who appeared agitated said:
"Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, has gone. Let the four divisions of the army of  which you are the commander proceed towards Ayodhya.
The army which is under your command O King is awaiting your orders like the chatakas awaiting water. Direct them (to proceed).
On hearing the words 'Parasurama has departed' from Rama, king Dasaratha embraced him and kissed his forehead. The king, immensely happy, felt he and his son were reborn.
Thereafter, king Dasaratha directed his army to proceed speedily in advance. When he    reached the city of Ayodhya it looked welldecorated with flags and banners. It  resounded with trumpets. The royal highways were sprinkiled with water and strewn with flowers. It was filled with groups of people. Awaiting with delight the arrival of  the king the citizens produced merry sounds with musical instruments.
Prosperous king Dasaratha of great fame followed by his elegant sons entered the city of Ayodhya while the citizens and brahmins came forward from a long distance to welcome him who reentered his palace looking like the Himalayan moutain.
The king and his kith and kin were received with honour in a pleasing manner. Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi of slender waist and other women attending on the king were busy in receiving the new brides.
Thereafter the queens received the highly fortunate Sita, Urmila of high fame and both the daughters of Kusadhwaja, Mandavi and Srutakirti.
With auspicious aricles in their hands, all the new brides who shone in silken apparels immediately went to temples and worshipped the family deities.
Then all the princesses paid obeisance to those worthy of worship and entered their residence that resembled the palace of Kubera.Thereafter pleased with gifting  cows, riches and corn to brahmins and satisfying them they joined their husbands and enjoyed themselves in privacy
All the princes who were best of men, great souls, incomparable in prowess on earth, capable of the use of weapons and endowed with wealth moved about with friends, serving their father and following his commands.
After some time king Dasaratha the delight of the Raghu race addressed his son Bharata:
"The heroic Yudhajit son of the king of Kekaya, your maternal uncle, has come here and wishes to take you with him, O Child
O Knower of dharma this was his request to me in Mithila in the midst of sages. You should bring him delight (by obliging him).
Having heard the words of Dasaratha, Bharata, son of Kaikeyi paid obeisance to his father and Rama, embraced Lakshmana and prepared for the journey with Satrughna.
Valiant Bharata, the best of men took leave of his father Dasaratha, a tireless brother Rama and mothers and departed with Satrughna.
After the departure of Bharata, mighty Rama  and Lakshmana continued to serve their godlike father.
Righteous Rama discharged his duties towards the citizens for their allround comfort and welfare giving top psriority to (the execution of) the command of his father.
With unfailing regularity Rama carried out his duties towards his mothers, and his elders, looking into them from time to time.
Dasaratha was pleased with the good conduct and character of Rama. Brahmanas as also the inhabitants of the city and the people of the country at large were happy with him.
In world the glorious and virtuous Rama armed with the power of truthfulness became the protector of the people like Brahma (to living beings).
With his heart fixed on Sita to whom he was always devoted, Rama, the wise went about enjoying with her (the beauty of) all the seasons.
Chosen by his father Sita became Rama's beloved wife with her virtue and beauty his affection for her grew further.
For sita her husband was doubly dear. They were clearly communicating through each other's heart every thought generated in the mind.
